Is Polyester Safe for Babies?,"
<p>Polyester has some desirable qualities which may tempt you to sew with it. It has anti-wrinkling properties, is very strong, and it won’t stretch or shrink. This means the baby products you make will stay looking good and will keep their shape. However, the chemical side is what we must question.</p>

<p>Polyester is not safe for babies. It is toxic, made by a chemical process that includes petroleum, coal, air, and water. It is actually a type of plastic, and when it heats up in the dryer, it off-gasses, emitting chemicals in the air that are harmful to breathe in.</p>

<p>In some cases, polyester may be treated with weather-resistant or flame-retardant chemicals. Polyester is naturally flame-retardant because of how tightly woven it is, but at times, it is still chemically treated to prevent it from melting in a flame, like plastic. This is not something you want any little cuties to put in their mouth, which they most likely will.</p>

<p>Polyester must also be dyed with a special dye. This dye is toxic to humans. Many dye workers have gotten sick with lung diseases and cancer after working with it for many years. Not only is this unsafe for babies, but it is unsafe for you as the person who sews with it.</p>

<p>In spite of this, so many baby products are being made with polyester.</p>

<p>Baby products that can be made with polyester include:</p>

<p>What are the effects it has on babies? Polyester is not a breathable fabric. It can make babies sweat and overheat, which may contribute to SIDS. When the body heats up, the chemicals can then be absorbed into the skin. This is scary and not something we want for the little ones!</p>

<p>Babies with sensitive skin, allergies, or eczema can be affected too. Polyester can cause eczema flare-ups due to the non-breathability of the fabric and the inevitable sweating that follows. This can cause rashes and leave a baby’s skin irritated and itchy. Even if the fabric feels soft, it is still synthetic and chemical-filled, which can cause issues if a baby has sensitive skin or eczema.</p>

<p>Of course, some products are worse offenders than others.</p>

<p>Polyester Baby Products to Avoid Sewing</p>

<p>Clothing and bedding are the worst because they surround the baby. You definitely don’t want a baby to be wrapped in plastic even if they don’t have any skin issues. It’s weird to think of a fabric as plastic, but that’s exactly what polyester is. Considering we know the properties of plastic, it’s never something we want near babies. It is dangerous and poses the risk of suffocation – something we can never take lightly. It is not a good choice to sew garments and bedding with.</p>

<p>Blankets could be extremely dangerous, especially if they cover the baby’s face by accident while they sleep. If you want to knit or crochet a blanket for a baby, avoid using polyester yarn. Yarn companies are marketing it as a great choice for baby projects, but it clearly is not.</p>

<p>If you want to sew a blanket, fleece wouldn’t be the best choice because it is a type of polyester, but it feels so soft and snuggly that you may think it’s perfect for babies. It is more breathable than regular polyester and has anti-perspiration traits, but it is loaded with chemicals to make it water-resistant and windproof.</p>

<p>Any polyester baby product that comes into direct contact with a baby’s skin should be avoided because of the skin, allergy, and respiratory issues it can cause.</p>

<p>If the project you make will need to be washed and go in the dryer, you should avoid it due to the risk of breathing in the harmful chemicals that will disperse into the air and the environment.</p>

<p>Anything that might go in a baby’s mouth should be avoided. They teethe and chew on everything. Before sewing a project, it’s important to be mindful of everything that goes into what you make, before it ends up in the tiny mouth of a curious child.</p>

<p>Sorry, polyester. You’ve been voted out.</p>

Is Sewing Hard to Learn (And Can You Teach Yourself)?,
What is the Softest T-Shirt Material?,"
<p>Tri-blend fabrics steal the show as the most available and affordable option for a soft t-shirt. Part of the affordability stems from the fact that tri-blend fabric usually incorporates at least one synthetic fiber, which knocks down the price compared to a natural fabric.</p>

<p>Of course, the incredible softness of this blended material is what makes it popular!</p>

<p>Various kinds of cotton also offer a luxurious, soft shirt, though this luxury often comes with a large price tag. High-end t-shirts are often made of pima and supima cotton. Fabrics like Egyptian and Sea Island Cotton also merit a mention for their exclusivity, priciness, and ultimate softness.</p>

<h3>Tri-Blend</h3>

<p>So, what makes tri-blend fabric so soft? Every fabric has strengths and weaknesses on its own, but blending them can create a material that celebrates all of the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of the three individual fibers. The tri-blend weave of polyester, cotton, and rayon creates a soft, supple fabric that has become wildly popular in the t-shirt world.</p>

<p>Today many brands that sell t-shirts use tri-blend fabric. You can purchase a tri-blend t-shirt at Walmart or on Amazon.com, but you can also find unique graphic tees with a slightly higher price tag for sale on Etsy and from big-name brands like American Apparel, Under Armor, and Hanes.</p>

<p>Most mass-produced tri-blend t-shirts use a blend of cotton, polyester, and rayon. The polyester fibers in the blend provide a cheap, durable base for the blend, while cotton boosts comfort appeal, and rayon adds the light, silky element of the texture.</p>

<p>“Triblend” in the garment industry usually means fabric made with a ratio of 50% polyester, 25 % cotton, and 25% rayon. You can always read the product description to double-check the composition of the fabric.</p>

<p>Some specialty shirts take the idea of a tri-blend fabric farther and think outside the box, using different fibers altogether. For example, the Two Blind Brothers sell clothing that is all about the texture and feel of each fabric. They sell a dress shirt made out of a tri-blend fabric comprised of 66% bamboo, 28% cotton, and 6% spandex; they consider this the softest fabric of all time!</p>

<h3>Pima and Supima Cotton T-Shirts</h3>

<p>Pima cotton also ranks highly in the competition for softest t-shirt fabric. This cotton sports a longer fiber than the average cotton, which allows for a higher thread count and creates a softer texture in the material. For purposes of comparison, you might be interested to know that pima cotton and Egyptian cotton both qualify as something called “extra-long-staple cotton.”</p>

<p>Supima cotton has even longer fibers than pima fabric, which makes it even more soft and silky. On top of that, supima fabric is only manufactured in the U.S. and comes with quality guarantees. (Of course, this also means that supima fabric costs even more than pima fabric!)</p>

<p>Only the United States, Australia, and Peru grow this high-end cotton, which is named after the Pima Indians who helped develop it in the early 1900s. Only a tiny percentage of the cotton grown every year is pima or supima, which adds to its high price tag.</p>

<p>Though you can certainly find reasonably priced pima cotton products, these shirts can also range anywhere from $200-$800 depending on the brand and seller. Brands like L.L. Bean, Calvin Klein, Gucci, and Lacoste all sell products made with pima cotton.</p>

<p>Pima cotton is a renewable (though rare) resource; anything made from natural fibers has the advantage of being a sustainable choice. Pima cotton also boasts incredible softness and the breathable quality that makes cotton so popular.</p>

<p>The two big downsides to purchasing a pima cotton t-shirt are the price tag and the fact that cotton is an absorbent fabric that does not dry quickly.</p>

<h3>Polyester and Cotton Blend</h3>

<p>Both 100% cotton and 100% polyester lack the super-soft qualities of tri-blend and pima cotton fabric; no one argues that these fabrics provide ultimate comfort! That said, 100% cotton and 100% polyester remain a popular material for t-shirts because of their affordability and durability.</p>

<p>When you think about varying levels of softness, 100% cotton has a familiar slightly thick, slightly thready feel to it–while certainly far softer than something like canvas or burlap, 100% cotton falls far short of the sleek, smooth texture of fabrics like rayon or cashmere. Because of this, some manufacturers treat 100% cotton t-shirts with special chemicals to give them a well-worn feel.</p>

<p>A 50/50 blend of cotton and polyester, which merges the breathability of cotton with the tensile strength of polyester, also makes a strong showing on the t-shirt market. This fabric often referred to simply as 50/50, holds color and printed designs quite well, which makes it a favorite in the t-shirt world.</p>

<p>The only difference between 50/50 and a tri-blend is that 50/50 lacks the soft silkiness of the rayon that merges into a tri-blend.</p>

What Do You Call a Person Who Sews?,"
<h3>Sewer</h3>

<p>Sewer (pronounced SOH-er) is the historic, widely recognized term that many needleworkers still use. The word “sew” has its roots in Latin, but the specific term “sewer” first emerged in medieval poetry. It became more widely used about 600 years ago, and quickly gained such popularity that Samuel Johnson listed “sewer” as a word to describe a person who uses a needle in the first English dictionary, published in 1755.  Today, published sewing guides often use phrases like “the home sewer” to describe a person who sews non professionally.</p>

<p>Not everyone likes the term sewer, though. Some modern writers include a hyphen, spelling the term as “sew-er” to avoid confusion with the waste-pipe kind of sewer. (Generally, it’s pretty easy to tell what kind of sewer you’re talking about based on context; still, it’s easy to see why people who sew wouldn’t want to be confused with a smelly drain pipe!). Some people who sew argue that sewer is an old-fashioned term and that all confusion can be avoided by using a brand-new term instead.</p>

<h3>Sewist</h3>

<p>Sewist isn’t recognized in any major dictionaries or sewing books yet. Plenty of bloggers and crafters use this new term, though, arguing that language is always evolving, and it’s time to embrace a new, easily understood term for anyone who does any kind of sewing. Considering one who duels is a duelist, so by extension, one who sews, is a sewist. The great thing about calling yourself a sewist is that no one will think you are talking about drainpipes.</p>

<p>Possibly the best thing about this new term is that it marries the idea of sewing with the elevated idea of art. This is great because sewing is art -you are creating something unique and intentional, whether you are using a pre-made pattern to cut out and sew your first handmade garment, crafting a toy for your child, or designing an intricate quilt. Sewing takes skill, time, and patience. People who embrace this art deserve a fancy new term like sewist!</p>

<p>The downside is that this term is so cutting-edge that even the Scrabble dictionary doesn’t consider it a real word. You might get some confused looks from your friends if you introduce the term in a conversation. Your spellcheck won’t like it, either.</p>

<h3>Seamstress</h3>

<p>If you sew professionally, you probably refer to yourself with a more specific term than either sewer or sewist. Seamstress is a catch-all term for a woman who sews professionally. Before the mass-production of sewing machines in the Industrial Revolution, many women earned money by hand-sewing in their homes. The term seamstress also referred to women who sewed for professional shops.</p>

<p>These days most professionals refer to themselves with an even more specific term, though. For example, a person who sells handmade dresses on Etsy likely refers to themselves as a dressmaker. Seamstress is a bit vague for someone who wants to market a particular sewing skill.</p>

<h3>Seamster</h3>

<p>This one has fallen out of favor these days. Technically, “seamster” is the term for a man who sews professionally. It is one of those words that just dropped out of use, though, probably because of the common practice of referring to men who sew as tailors. Seamster does have a cool ring to it, though!</p>

<h3>Tailor</h3>

<p>Tailor is another term for someone who sews professionally. Tailoring is the art of altering clothes. If you have ever needed to get a suit fitted before an important job interview, you probably visited a tailor. (If you have never tried altering a piece of clothing, you may not realize how difficult it is! Really good alterations require a lot of skill.). Some tailors also sew clothing, though, especially suits and coats. This is another fairly broad term that has evolved to encompass more than one particular skill.</p>

<h3>Couturier</h3>

<p>A couturier is a fashion designer who makes and sells clothes for a client. Couturier is the French word for dressmaker, but these days it is usually used to describe high fashion. Coco Chanel was a famous couturier that pretty much everyone has heard of. People in the fashion industry today also call themselves fashion designers, or haute couture designers.</p>

<h3>Dressmaker</h3>

<p>Okay, this term is pretty self-explanatory. If you design and/or sew dresses, you probably call yourself a dressmaker. This is a great term for both professional and hobby sewers! Historically, dressmaker was usually referring only to women who sewed dresses.  Of course, dressmaker is a specific term. If you sew stuffed animals, placemats, or Renaissance Faire kilts, this is not a term you would want to use to describe your hobby.</p>

How Much Does a T-Shirt Weigh?,"
<p>More and more online outlets are providing information about the weight of different items of clothing. Whether for shipping calculations or to provide shoppers with extra information about a product, it can improve your shopping success. The weight is especially helpful if you know the weight ranges of T-shirts for your size, as it provides a reference when ordering shirts or blouses, as well as your favorite Ts.</p>

<p>Adult T-shirts range from 3oz to 7oz or more depending on several different factors. The weight is affected by fabric composition, thread count and thickness, printing or stenciling, and even humidity. It can further reflect different sizes and even genders too.</p>

<p>The heft can also be used within a size to identify fabric weave, thickness, and quality. A T-shirt between 3oz and 5oz is considered lightweight, between 5oz and 6oz is medium, and those over 6oz are heavyweight. It should be noted though, that medium weight fabric may be used to produce lightweight Ts.</p>

<p>It is important to know the weight of your favorite Ts to prevent confusion. A small adult T-shirt weighing 6.5oz will be much thicker and heavier than a 3oz one, while a 2XL with the same 6.5oz mass, will be almost as thin and light as a 4oz adult small due to the extra fabric. Another confusing issue is how stores report weight: ounces, grams, pounds, or kilograms.</p>

<p>Converting between ounces and grams or pounds and kilograms can be a daunting task laced with nightmares of junior high math. If you grew up learning there were 16oz in a pound or 1000g in a kilogram, then one unit may prove easier than the other. Unfortunately, the unit of measure you’re comfortable with may not be what is listed.</p>

<p>Here are some helpful conversions:</p>

<p>Most manufacturers don’t list the weight of shirts, nor do they identify the amount of fabric that goes into each item. If you are a sewer or sewist, you may have a general idea of how much fabric is needed to make a T-shirt in your size and the weight and kind of fabric you prefer.</p>

<p>Lightweight cotton T-shirt fabric often weighs 2 ounces a square yard, medium weight is around 4oz, and thick or heavyweight is 6oz or more a square. The width of the cloth influences how many yards in length you may need to purchase – 36”, 42”, 54”, 60” – but the weight per square yard remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The weight of the fabric per square yard or meter, multiplied by the amount of fabric in that size of T-shirt, will identify its approximate weight. The weight can be used to identify if the shirt is light, medium, or heavyweight.</p>

<p>A small adult T commonly uses 0.94 yds² and a 2XL approximately 1.5 yds². That means a 2XL would weigh 8.34oz if made of mid-weight 5.56oz cotton T-shirt fabric but only 3oz if made of lightweight 2oz cotton – a significant difference in feel, warmth, and durability.</p>

<p>The average amount of fabric in a T-shirt based on size can be calculated with 4 simple measurements. The length from where the neck and shoulder join down to the desired hem-line multiplied by the width across the chest under the arms added to that the length of the sleeve from shoulder to cuff after multiplying it by double the width of the sleeve at its cuff. The sum of the two parts is then multiplied by 2 since there are two sleeves and a front and a back.</p>

<p>There are 1,296 square inches in a square yard, and 10,000 square centimeters in a square meter. There are 2.54cm in an inch, and 1in² = 6.4516cm². The Table below identifies the average amount of fabric found in different uni-sex T-shirts.</p>

Do Fabric Markers Wash Off?,"
<p>The simple answer is that permanent fabric markers do not wash out. The ink used in these pens is not water-soluble. This means that water does not dissolve the ink and cannot remove it from the material.</p>

<p>If you want to know how this works, here’s some science for you: the ink in permanent markers consists of a resin, a colorant, and a solvent.</p>

<p>The colorant in these pens is usually an incredibly finely ground pigment that gives the ink that vibrant color. The solvent is a liquid that carries the pigment, usually some type of alcohol. Finally, the resin is a polymer that binds the color pigment to the surface when you write or draw with the pen.</p>

Is Polypropylene Fabric Waterproof?,
Is Polyester Warm Enough For Winter?,
What Does Polyester Feel Like?,"
<p>Polyester fabric can have a variety of different textures depending on how it is made. This means that you might find a polyester dress shirt that feels cheap and crinkly sold by one brand and a smooth, soft polyester knit sold by another brand.</p>

<p>In general, though, polyester fabric has certain shared characteristics.</p>

<h3>Softness</h3>

<p>The softness of polyester depends on its manufacturing process. These days, textile sciences have advanced to the degree that polyester can mimic many different kinds of natural fibers, including silk, very successfully.</p>

<p>However, depending on the process used to turn it into cloth, it can also have a rougher weave that catches on your fingertips as you smooth them across its surface.</p>

<p>In the early days of synthetic fabrics, polyester was often sold as something called “double-knit” with a rough, scratchy surface. Today, even 100% polyester has a fairly smooth surface, though it can have a shiny and slightly sticky feel.</p>

<p>People argue about whether microfiber or cotton feels softer. You will have to decide for yourself! Either way, you can see that polyester can be extremely soft, depending on how it is made.</p>

<h3>Comfort</h3>

<p>Is polyester comfortable? Many factors go into determining whether or not you find a garment comfortable, including how it is cut, how it fits your particular body type, and how the fabric feels.</p>

<p>If you focus just on the feel of the fabric, though, some people do find it hot and clingy. This is because polyester fibers lack pores. Many natural fibers allow air to circulate, but polyester fibers do not.</p>

<p>However, while 100% polyester lacks breathability, it is often blended with natural fabrics to create a more breathable poly-blend. You may find this more comfortable than 100% polyester.</p>

<p>Some people do have an allergic reaction to the chemicals used to treat synthetic fabrics. If you find yourself itchy or uncomfortable while wearing polyester, you should choose natural fabrics instead!</p>

<p>Most people, though, find polyester quite soft and comfortable, aside from the potential breathability issue.</p>

<h3>Thickness</h3>

<p>The weight of any fabric depends entirely on how the material is crafted. Polar fleece, for instance, can be more than half an inch thick! Polyester sateen, on the other hand, may feel as thin and light as a wisp of silk.</p>

What Is Spun Polyester Fabric?,
What Is Interlock Knit Fabric?,"
<p>Interlock knit fabric is a variation of rib knit. Rib knit is a type of fabric knitted with rows that alternate between being raised and lowered. But instead of having just one row of stitches, interlock knit fabric has two rows of stitches.</p>

<p>The rows of stitches are created one behind the other, using two rows of needles that cross over each other to construct it. Because of the two rows, interlock knit fabric is known as a double knit fabric. The rows become “interlocked” as the fabric is knitted. The interlocked, double rows also create a fabric that is thicker than regular knit fabric.</p>

<p>While the construction of interlock fabrics makes the fabric feel very firm, it also has a soft and smooth texture. The thickness of the fabric makes it very absorbent as well. Overall, interlock knit fabric is very comfortable and can be used for a variety of things.</p>

<p>These special thin yarns give the fabric its light, silky feel that creates a comfortable bed sheet.</p>

<p>Indeed, microfiber sheets are often seen as the economical option, while cotton sheets star as the luxury option. That said, advances in the textile industry have gone a long way to making high-class synthetic sheets competitive with cotton or other natural fabrics.</p>

<p>For example, today you can buy microfiber sheets in either percale or sateen weave, depending on your preference. Percale weave has a cottony, crisp feel and features the typical over-under weave of most woven fabrics. Sateen weave uses a special method to move the weft yarns to the top of the fabric to create a tight, satiny finish that drapes elegantly and feels silky to the touch!</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, this man-made, synthetic fabric costs much less to manufacture than a natural kind of cloth-like cotton. This means that microfiber sheets cost less than most other options on the market.</p>

Does Denim Shrink?,"
<p>Unless you buy pre-shrunk denim, it is very likely that denim will shrink, especially denim jeans. The most common cause of denim shrinking happens when you launder it in the washing machine or dryer. You should be prepared for some amount of shrinking to occur, especially after the first wash.</p>

<h3>Why Does Denim Shrink?</h3>

<p>Denim shrinks because of what it is made of. Many people don’t know this, but most denim is made of either 100% cotton or a cotton blend. Cotton is known to shrink when you wash it due to using hot water or high heat. Denim shrinks for the same reason.</p>

<p>When you wash denim or other fabrics made primarily of cotton, they tend to shrink when exposed to heat. That’s because the fabric is made up of plant fibers. Plants tend to wilt when they get too hot, and the same thing happens to plant-based fabrics.</p>

<p>Heat causes the fibers to constrict, shrinking them. Denim can shrink as much as 10% after the first wash. It’s important to treat denim the same way as you would cotton, especially when you wash and dry it.</p>

<h3>Does Denim Shrink Over Time?</h3>

<p>Even though denim shrinks a little more the first time you wash them, it can continue to shrink over time with continued washing as well. But the amount of shrinking that occurs during other washes is small and isn’t permanent.</p>

<p>This is because denim is designed to stretch when you wear it to fit your body type better. The more you wear it, the better it will fit because the fibers become stretched out. But after you wear a pair of jeans, for example, the fibers shrink a little after being stretched out. They will stretch back the next time you wear the jeans.</p>

<h3>Does Denim Shrink When Not Worn?</h3>

<p>No, denim should not shrink if you don’t wear it. Leaving denim hanging in your closet isn’t going to cause it to shrink because most shrinking occurs during washing and drying them. However, that doesn’t mean that you should never wear or wash it to keep it from shrinking. As long as you care for it carefully, you have nothing to worry about.</p>

Does Acetone Stain Clothes?,
Does Baby Oil Stain Clothes?,"
<p>As you can probably gather from the name, baby oil is an oil-based product. Other examples of oil-based products include salad dressing, mayonnaise, butter, and some types of makeup. Most of us have had experience with spilling food or makeup on our clothes, but spilling baby oil on our clothes may be a new experience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, baby oil can stain clothes just like other oil-based products can. And the problem with oil stains is that they are harder to remove from clothes. Most fabrics aren’t made to wick away oil in the same way that they wick away water. And unlike oil, even if water is absorbed by clothing, it doesn’t leave behind a stain.</p>

<p>Other stains that aren’t oil-based can also be removed with just detergent and water in most cases. This isn’t the case with oil stains. While a soap that cuts grease may help remove some of the oil, the stain can’t be washed away with just water.</p>

<p>Oil and water do not mix well, so it makes sense that you can’t simply remove an oil stain by washing it in the washing machine. The key to removing this stain is to use the appropriate products as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>What Does A Baby Oil Stain Look Like?</h3>

<p>You may think that since baby oil is clear, the stain wouldn’t be that noticeable. But it isn’t the lack of color that’s the problem. It’s the thicker consistency and the chemicals that make it up that cause a stain to be left behind. Fabrics don’t absorb baby oil in the same way that they do other spills.</p>

<p>So if you’re wondering if baby oil is going to be noticeable if you spill it on your clothes and leave it untreated, the answer is probably so. The stain probably won’t be a different color than the clothing. But you may notice an area that is generally the same color as the clothing but darkened slightly.</p>

<p>The stain may also look “greasy.” But how noticeable the stain is will depend on the color of the clothing and the type of fabric it is made of. For example, you may notice an oil stain on a white shirt more than you would a navy blue or black one. Also, an oil stain may not be as noticeable on jeans as it would be on a t-shirt.</p>

<p>Even though you may not notice a baby oil stain on your darker-colored clothing right now, it could become more noticeable over time. This is especially true if the color of the clothing fades due to being washed repeatedly. The dye will fade, but the area where the stain is will not.</p>

<p>If you decide not to treat the stain because you think it will eventually come out, it won’t. You’re risking making the stain more noticeable by deciding to leave it alone. That is something that you don’t want to do if it’s a favorite piece of clothing or one that you wear all the time.</p>

Does Green Tea Stain Clothes?,"
<p>Green tea is water-based, but that doesn’t mean that it won’t leave behind a stain. It will stain your clothes, but the stain isn’t too hard to remove. Unlike oil-based stains that are harder to remove, you can usually remove a green tea stain by washing it in the washing machine. But it all depends on how quickly you treat the stain and if you applied the appropriate stain treatment first.</p>

<p>One thing about green tea that is important to mention is that you can drink it hot or cold. The temperature of the green tea when it was spilled determines how quickly it will stain and how easy it is to remove.</p>

<p>If you spill green tea that is hot on your clothes, it will stain faster because heat relaxes the clothing fibers. That also means that hot green tea will cause the stain to set in faster, making it harder to remove. On the other hand, cold green tea will take longer to leave a stain because the tea won’t set it into the fibers as quickly.</p>

<p>But why exactly does green tea leave stains? The answer is something called tannins. Tannins are a biological, plant-based chemical that can be found in all types of tea. They provide flavor to tea and also produce antioxidants, which is one reason why tea has nutritional benefits. But tannins are also what cause green tea to leave behind stains.</p>

<p>The concentration of tannins that can be found in tea depends on the type of tea you are drinking, but generally, green tea has the lowest amount. However, the amount of tannins in a single cup of tea depends on how long you steep it. Basically, the longer you let the tea steep and its hotter, the more likely it is to stain.</p>

Does Food Coloring Stain Clothes?,"
<p>Food coloring will almost always stain your clothes on contact because it is designed to transfer highly condensed color very easily. That said, different kinds of cloth react in unique ways to these coloring agents. For instance, synthetics like polyester will resist stains more easily than natural materials like cotton.</p>

<p>Most artificial food dye contains synthetic material derived from petroleum and a variety of condensed coloring agents. These range from ground-up insects to certain bacterias, as well as plant-derived dyes like indigo.</p>

<p>When the first synthetic (man-made) food dyes appeared on the scene, manufacturers made them using something called coal tar as the base for the dyes! Today they have an oil base made from petroleum.</p>

<p>This may sound gross to you. In fact, for the past fifty years or so scientists and health experts have held many debates over the safety of several kinds of food coloring. Despite this, manufacturers and consumers continue to love the bold, appealing color produced by these artificial dyes.</p>

<p>You can find or create your own all-natural additives using items like turmeric to create a yellow tinge or beets for a pinkish hue. However, the food coloring you buy from stores is almost always artificial and typically comes from liquid, gel, or powder.</p>

<p>Technically, this food additive is a type of acid dye. These kinds of dye have a type of acid in their molecular structure but have no caustic properties. You can even safely ingest them in the case of food colorings! Textile designers use acid dyes to color protein-based fibers such as wool, silk, and feathers.</p>
"
Is Polyester Breathable?,
Does Acrylic Paint Wash Off Clothes?,"
<p>Acrylic paint can wash out of clothes with proper treatment, such as applying hairspray or isopropyl alcohol. Because this paint is water-soluble, you can often rinse it away entirely if you catch the paint stain before it dries!</p>

<p>That said, once acrylics dry and harden onto fabric, it becomes much more difficult to wash the paint out of clothing. Besides creating potentially unsightly colorful blobs on your clothing, acrylic paint dries hard and plasticky, making fabric stiff to the touch. This may make your clothes uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Unless the paint stain is super fresh, this paint likely will not come out of clothes in a regular wash. It may fade slightly, but you need to apply a special treatment to entirely remove acrylic paint from clothing. You do not want to place a paint-stained garment in your dryer, as the heat will make the paint pretty much permanent.</p>

<p>For example, if you smeared acrylic paint on your jeans while working on an art project, first check to see if the paint is still damp. If it is, blot the paint right away with a wet cloth, and then proceed to one of the eight methods you will find in this article.</p>

<p>If the paint is already dried, try scraping away as much as you can off the surface of the jeans. After that, try a treatment such as applying isopropyl alcohol to dissolve some of the dried-on paint.</p>

<p>On the flip side, if you want acrylic paint to remain on your clothing (for example, if you painted a t-shirt or jacket with a cool design), you will want to mix a special textile medium into the paint to prevent it from cracking or remaining stiff and plasticky on top of the fabric. With this medium mixed in, you can wash clothing painted with acrylics without worrying about damaging the design, which will remain permanent.</p>
"
How Much Fabric Do I Need?,"
<p>It’s important to gauge how much fabric you’ll use in a project. There’s nothing worse than reaching the halfway point of a task to find you can’t finish it.</p>

<p>The return trip to the store to buy more supplies is distracting, inconvenient, and will have a befuddling effect on your brain. You’ll lose more than just time, you’ll lose track of where you are in the project. Having to rethink what you were doing when you get back will put a big dent in your incentive to complete your project.</p>

<p>To avoid the drain on your productivity, what do you need to focus on to make sure you get the right amount of fabric?</p>

<h3>Different Projects require Different Amounts</h3>

<p>The amount of fabric you need depends on the type of project you’re planning. From clothing to upholstery and home décor, each project is unique.</p>

<p>As well as requiring different amounts of fabric, you’ll find the type of fabric will be different too! Chairs need a heavier, durable material whereas blouses need lighter weight fabrics.</p>

<p>Each style or type of fabric comes on a particular sized roll or bolt. For curtains, you could be looking at a roll measuring over 100 inches in width. Fabric for clothing, on the other hand, comes on bolts or rolls from 36 – 60 inches wide.</p>

<p>The wider the fabric, the less you need. Your project and the style of fabric will have a huge effect on how much you need.</p>

<h3>How Big Is My Project?</h3>

<p>It sounds a little obvious but, have you sat down and thought about the project you are undertaking? How big is it?</p>

<p>Accurately assessing the amount of fabric you need relies on you knowing the true size of what you are trying to do. Let’s say you want to smarten up your living room by rejuvenating the tired old threadbare sofa with fresh, vibrantly colored fabric.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to measure is the sofa’s cushions. They are box-shaped so each one has a top, bottom, and sides. Then you need to consider the arms, the base, the back…</p>

<p>There is so much to measure in a sofa; it’s easy to forget something. Also, remember the rest of the room. How will the revived sofa fit in with your décor? Your armchair, for instance. Does it need new covers to match? What about your throw pillows?</p>

<p>Whenever you are working with fabric, you need to remember the hidden aspects of sewing. Things like seam allowance, pleats, gathers, and hems.</p>

<p>Most modern commercial patterns include an allowance for sewing the fabric pieces together and finishing edges. If you use your own self-drafted pattern though, remember to add extra space for seams, hems, and decorative finishes to ensure the item fits.</p>

<p>Also consider pattern matching. This is where you arrange the fabric at the seam line, so the pattern on the fabric is continuous. Making the seam almost invisible. Matching patterns or bold prints successfully requires more fabric than the sewing pattern recommends.</p>

<p>Before you think about fabric and the yardage needed, plan your intended project. What does it entail? Once you understand the size of your project, you’ll be able to gauge your fabric requirements.</p>

<h3>Why is it Better to Have Extra Fabric?</h3>

<p>One of the main reasons for making sure you have plenty of fabric is the color of the dye. Bolts or rolls of fabric are made in lots. Each lot will use the same dye.</p>

<p>The color of the dye can change from one batch of fabric to another. If you have to buy more fabric, you run the risk of an obvious color change. You might think it’s the same hue in the store, but when you get home, the difference could stand out like a sore thumb. Especially if you can’t hide the change in an inconspicuous area.</p>

<p>Another reason is making errors. Fabric cutting, in particular, is one of those areas that trips us all up. Having spare fabric to hand when you’ve been a bit liberal with the scissors is a great way to save your sanity.</p>

<p>While it’s true accurate calculations lead to a leaner, budget-friendly project, allowing wiggle room with extra fabric, could work out more economical in the long run.</p>

<p>It may seem a little extravagant at first but it saves you the horror of running out of fabric and not being able to find more. Besides, you can use the leftovers to make matching throw pillows, fashion accessories, or other small projects. Win win!</p>

<h3>How Big Is A Yard of Fabric?</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Fabric can come in a range of widths suitable for different projects. Material with a width of 110 inches, for instance, is ideal for larger tasks. Quilters’ cotton tends to be around 45 inches wide. Fabric for clothing can be a variety of widths from 36 inches to 58 inches. When it comes to fabric width you’re spoiled for choice.</p>

<p>A yard of the fabric refers to the length of the material. Whether you buy fabric for clothing, upholstery or bedding, the length will always be measured in yards, or if you use the metric system, meters.</p>

<p>How much fabric you get in that yard depends on how wide your chosen material is. For example, let’s use a width of 60 inches. If we use feet to make calculations a little easier, 60 inches is equal to 5 feet. A yard is the same as 3 feet. Multiplying the two together (5ft x 3ft), gives us 15 square feet of fabric. This is the surface area.</p>

<p>A shorter width of fabric will give you less surface area so your yard of fabric, although the same length, will be smaller overall. See our article How Big Is A Yard of Fabric for more information.</p>
"
Is Polyamide Fabric Stretchy?,
What Is Polyamide Fabric?,"
<p></p>

<p>When you hear the name polyamide, it’s easy to think it’s some form of polyester. Polyamide fabrics can be synthetic and are therefore presumed to be plastic. But, they aren’t members of the polyester family. Although the name would suggest it should be polyester, the artificial form is known as nylon.</p>

<p>Polyamide fabrics aren’t always made from synthetic materials. Polyamide is a term used to describe the molecular structure of the fiber, regardless of whether it’s artificial or organic. Natural fibers like silk and wool are classed as polyamides. To understand why the polyamide genome can be used to cover both types of fiber, we need to look at the chemistry behind the terminology.</p>

<p>As the most popular plastic-based fabric is called polyester, it can be tempting to think the prefix “poly” stands for plastic. It doesn’t. Poly comes from the word polymer, which means a substance made from long chains of similar blocks all joined together. They are joined, or linked, by amides. Hence the name poly-amide.</p>

<p>Although polyamide technically covers both natural and synthetic fibers, we don’t refer to the organic versions by their molecular term. We call the natural products by their fiber name of wool or silk. We only describe synthetic materials by their chemical term. This is why we think of synthetic materials when we see the word polyamide. With that in mind, it’s the synthetic version we’ll be concentrating on in this article.</p>

<p>Synthetic polyamide fabrics are petroleum-based and have many characteristics of artificial fibers, both good and bad. They are not breathable fabrics and can feel like plastic against the skin. Their incredible strength and durability feature highly in the popularity of these fabrics for both fashion and industrial uses.</p>

<p>Nylon, Kevlar, and Nomex are all examples of synthetic polyamide fabric. Kevlar is used in the construction of bullet-proof vests. Nomex is a brand name for DuPont’s heat and flame-resistant textiles. Nylon was famously used for parachutes in World War 2 and is still a popular choice for a range of products from tights to umbrellas.</p>

<p>Polyamide fabrics have differences that set them apart from their closest synthetic rival, polyester. While polyester is quick-drying and water-resistant, polyamides like nylon are absorbent and slow to dry. This unique difference can make polyamides more comfortable to wear.</p>

Does Hand Sanitizer Stain Clothes?,"
<p>Although hand sanitizers don’t ‘stain’ clothes, some fabrics can be damaged by the ingredients found in many brands. As we apply the sanitizer, it can spill or splatter onto clothing and other surfaces. When the liquid lands on fabric, it forms little discolored spots that can look like stains. The marks are in fact where the fabric has been bleached.</p>

<p>Alcohol is one of the main ingredients in sanitizers due to its antibacterial qualities. It’s also a known stain remover. This can be a bit of a problem when it comes to our clothing. As far as alcohol is concerned, there is no difference between stains and colors.</p>

<p>The stain removing properties of alcohol relies on its ability to act as a bleaching agent. In other words, it alters the look of an item by removing its color. Unfortunately, because the alcohol is dropped in random places and tiny amounts, the bleaching process only works in affected areas. Leaving a spotted effect on the fabrics.</p>

What Is the Best Fabric for Canopy Beds?,"
<p>The best fabric for a canopy bed is the one that gives you a look you were hoping to achieve. Modern canopies can be made from any type of material. Your choice ultimately depends on your room décor, personal preference, and the style of your chosen canopy.</p>

<p>With so many fabrics available and a project that can use any of them, picking one can seem like a daunting task. Let’s take a look at some fabrics more commonly used for canopies. By checking them out side-by-side, you should be able to tell which one will be best for your canopy bed.</p>

<h3>1. Lace</h3>

<p>Better suited to canopies that need smaller amounts of fabric, lace in large quantities can be a bit overwhelming.</p>

<p>Crown and half-tester style canopies are a good choice for this type of fabric.</p>

<h3>2. Silk</h3>

<p>You may find a full-size canopy with floating drapes a bit pricey if you make it out of pure silk.</p>

<p>A silk alternative like rayon can give the same effect with a cheaper price tag.</p>

<h3>3. Velvet</h3>

<p>Suitable for any style of the canopy, watch the overall weight with this fabric. Some velvets can be incredibly heavyweight.</p>

<p>This could be a problem if your canopy type relies on being suspended from the ceiling rather than on posts.</p>

<h3>4. Chintz</h3>

<p>It’s another traditional fabric used for canopy beds that has a modern aesthetic and appeal.</p>

<p>As cotton is available in lightweight and heavier weight weaves, this choice is ideal for any style of canopy. If cottagecore is your thing, this one is right up your street.</p>

<h3>5. Tapestry</h3>

<p>Because of the nature of the fabric, this one is a heavyweight.</p>

<p>Perfect for full-size canopy beds with the traditional four-poster style, you might find a tapestry design a little heavy for the softer crown or half tester style beds.</p>

<h3>6. Muslin</h3>

<p>Slightly translucent and having a nice drape, it’s an ideal material for creating romantic canopy beds.</p>

<p>Muslin can be used for any style of the canopy and can be used as a full covering or gentle, strips of delicate swags. Either way, muslin will give your bedroom a hint of romance.</p>

<h3>7. Gingham</h3>

<p>A gingham weave in any color will give your room a sense of rural chic. This one is a popular choice for any canopy but looks particularly impressive when used in the crown style. Embrace your inner cottagecore with the pastel simplicity of gingham.</p>

<p>While viscose will absorb moisture from your skin, it takes the fabric a lot longer to dry than most other fabrics. It will cool you down, but it may begin to feel clammy if it gets too wet while you’re wearing it.</p>

<p>Due to these two properties, manufacturers often mix it with other fibers to make fabric blends. The blend helps lower the cost of a garment or fabric without sacrificing the look, feel, or properties of the second fiber.</p>

Is Viscose Stretchy Material?,
What Is the Most Breathable Fabric?,
What Is the Standard Width of Fabric Bolt?,"
<p></p>

<p>Fabric width varies by manufacturer and fabric type. While there isn’t a standard width for all fabric bolts, there are ways to estimate how wide fabric is before you measure it. Similar fabrics tend to have similar widths; for example, most cotton fabrics have the same width whereas most wools have the same width, but wool and cotton won’t necessarily have the same width as each other.</p>

<p>The average width for fabric you’d find in a local craft store or fabric store is between 40 and 60 inches. When you see fabric rolled up on rectangular cardboard bolts, it’s safe to assume that the width is going to fall somewhere between 35 inches and 108 inches. Knowing the kind of fabric will help you make a closer guess.</p>

<h3>What Is Single Width Fabric?</h3>

<p>Single-width fabric refers to any fabric that’s wrapped around the bolt unfolded. When you unroll a single-width fabric, you’ll only have one layer on your cutting table. The selvage edges will be on opposite sides of the fabric, and you’ll be able to clearly see the right and wrong sides of the fabric. Single-width fabric is usually wrapped around the bolt with the right side facing outwards, so you can see it.</p>

<h3>What Is Double Width Fabric?</h3>

<p>Double width fabric is a fabric that is folded in half widthwise before the manufacturer wraps it around the bolt. When you unwrap this fabric, the selvage edges will be on the same side, and the opposite side will have a fold.</p>

<p>This is how extremely wide fabrics like upholstery or drapery fabrics are packaged. Typically, the right side of the fabric will face outwards, and the wrong sides will be facing each other inside the fold. When you cut this fabric off the bolt, you’ll have a double layer.</p>

<h3>Fabrics with Narrow Widths</h3>

<p>Narrow fabrics tend to be materials that you use for smaller pieces, like interfacing. You don’t need as much width, so bolts of interfacing tend to be closer to 30 inches than 40. Vintage fabrics, especially cottons and muslins, also tend to be narrower than 40 inches.</p>

<p>Smaller looms lead to narrower fabrics, so fabric manufactured outside of a commercial setting is more likely to be narrow. These fabrics are generally older, or more specialty. It is rare to find these fabrics in your average fabric store.</p>

<h3>Fabrics with Average Widths</h3>

<p>The vast majority of fabrics that you’ll find today will fall within the 40 to 60-inch range. Quilting cotton and most apparel fabric fit these parameters. Within this range, quilting fabrics tend to be larger than others.</p>

<p>Cotton is typically a few inches wider than flannel, and wool is usually a few inches wider than cotton. All of these, however, will be single-width fabrics. If you find an apparel fabric that’s folded double on the bolt, it’s going to be an extra wide fabric.</p>

<h3>Wider than Average Fabrics (Extra Wide Fabric)</h3>

<p>The most common extra wide fabrics are for upholstery and home decor. These fabrics tend to be packaged as double width because they’re so wide. They are typically between 54 inches and 108 inches wide. Home decor fabrics with intricate patterns like brocades are usually extra wide to reduce the need for pattern matching and seaming on large items, like couches or drapes.</p>

<p>Some less common apparel fabrics also show up in extra wide widths. Knit jersey, corduroy, and twill skew wider, because of the way they’re made. Knit jersey is more likely to be sold double width than corduroy, however, because it is easier to fold.</p>

<p>Quilt backing is also commonly sold in extra wide widths. Backing an entire quilt in one seamless piece of fabric usually requires more than 60 inches in width. A standard queen-size bed is 60 inches across, so making quilts to fit anything larger than a queen requires wider quilt backing.</p>
"
Is Polyester Stretchy?,
Does Flannel Shrink?,"
<p>Flannels shrink when you wash them in hot water. By hot water, it means 120 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. This popular fall fabric needs your loving, tender care, so when washing your favorite flannel pajamas, boyfriend’s shirt, or blanket, set your washer to cool water. A low-heat setting, or warm water, is also okay.</p>

<p>Most flannels are made up of wool. Wool is a type of textile fiber that comes from animal hair— such as sheep and goats. The surface of these animal hairs is comprised of microscopic scales. When these scales are exposed to heat, they mesh and shrink, causing the wool to stiffen and get shorter.</p>

<p>Apart from heat exposure, there are other reasons why flannel can shrink. Yes, this fabric is notorious for shrinking when tumbling. Let us count the ways!</p>

<h3>Tumbling Action</h3>

<p>Some modern-day flannels are made up of 100% cotton. Some say cotton does not shrink when exposed to heat. That’s a complete myth. Cotton shrinks when it tumbles inside your washing machine or dryer.</p>

<p>When washing your flannel in cold water (whether it’s made up of wool, cotton, or synthetics), it is important that you set your washer to a “gentle cycle”. When violently churned, flannel can either shrink, fray, and pill.</p>

<p>Yes, flannel can get stressed and shrink in size when you beat it up with rigorous washing. Be kind to your flannel. If you don’t trust your washing machine, then hand-wash your ultimate cozy fabric.</p>

<h3>Low-quality Flannel</h3>

<p>If there are good quality flannels, then there are also low-quality ones. Your cheap flannel can shrink over time. It is important to know what to check when you are shopping for one of the coziest and most breathable fabrics on Earth.</p>

<p>First, check the weave. One way to check is by tugging it a little, and if it gets warped a little, then you know you have the poor quality kind. High-quality flannel is a little heavy, full and thick, and has a natural fluff to it. Brush it up against your cheek for its fuzziness. Authentic flannel does not lay flat.</p>

<h3>Bad Chemicals</h3>

<p>The wrong choice of detergent can kill your flannel and cause it to downgrade in size. Washing with detergents that you merely picked by random is a no-no. Chemicals in your laundry soap, like chlorine, enzymes, and phosphates are dangerous to your winter flannels.</p>

<p>Using a fabric softener is also bad for your flannels. Your fragrant fabric softener contains chemicals that create an invisible coat over the fabric that chokes the fibers. Unable to breathe because of the softener’s barrier-causing chemicals, the fibers can no longer hold the fabric’s shape.</p>

<h3>Drying Them Hot</h3>

<p>You would not want to remove your flannel shirt from the dryer and be surprised that it has shrunk to the size that would fit someone half your size. Drying this fabric hot will automatically cause your flannel to magically become 2 to 3 sizes smaller. So, it’s not just washing them in hot water, but also drying them in heat, that will damage your flannel.</p>

What Is the Best Fabric for Pants?,
Is Silk Fabric Stretchy?,"
<p>This natural fiber is very elastic, but one single cocoon is not enough to create the textile. When these single strings are put together to form textiles, some of the elasticity decreases. In order to make silk, someone has to unwind the string of the cocoon and then connect it to another string. It takes about five cocoons to create a whole thread of this material. Over 2,000 cocoons are needed to produce a pound of silk.</p>

<p>The elasticity of this material depends on how it was knit or woven together. Most of the material is a lightweight, smooth weave that usually allows for some stretch. However, heavy-weight silk weave fabrics do exist and while they would not typically be stretchy, they could be with water or some steaming. Sometimes the textiles are mixed with stretchier fabrics such as spandex and nylon to provide more elasticity.</p>

<p>These textiles are used in many ways for different reasons. The material is great for summer blouses and dresses because of how breathable it is. It can also be insulating which makes it great for bedsheets and scarves. The textiles’ natural drape and notable shine make for great bridal wear too.</p>

<p>These four types of textiles are very stretchy and often used in silk products today.</p>

<p>Some silks are mixed fabrics and have more stretch to them. Some of the weaves are tight, and that type of silk can still be stretchy. Another type of textile with a different tight weave can be too stiff to stretch. These textiles are made in a large variety of weaves and knits which is why the fabrics vary in elasticity and weight.</p>

Does Cutting Paper Dull Fabric Scissors?,"
<p>Yes, cutting paper will dull your fabric scissors. So, if you have high-quality sewing scissors you should avoid cutting paper or anything else with them.</p>

<p>While you can cut some paper just fine with your fabric scissors, it will eventually dull them. This is due to the harsh minerals and materials that go into the paper. The stiffening agents in most papers are the worst offenders.</p>

<p>In particular, abrasive materials like talc and kaolin clay damage and dull fabric scissors. The sharp edge of sewing scissors is simply not made to take damage like that.</p>

<p>Cardboard and similar materials should also be avoided. In short, do not cut anything other than fabric with fabric scissors.</p>

<p>If you end up accidentally cutting paper or anything other than fabric, not all is lost. While it will dull the scissors, it is fairly easy to sharpen them.</p>

Is Wool Flammable?,"
<p>Wool is made by shearing the coat off of animals. Many think only sheep produce this material but some of the finest of these fabrics come from camels or llamas. After the material is sheared, it’s cleaned to remove excess oils. Sometimes it’s dyed right after the cleaning process and then it’s referred to as stock-dyed wool.</p>

<p>After cleaning the product, it gets sorted into different grades of fleece. The fleece is then flattened with a big metal machine and threaded into yarn. The material can also be dyed after being spun into yarn.</p>

<p>Wool can catch fire, but because of its cell structure, it will likely extinguish any flame that ignites. The reason this material is easy to dye is that it is naturally hydrophilic. This means it likes water. Its natural water contents make it difficult to catch fire. The fact that it has such a high water content as well as a high nitrogen content makes it difficult to ignite and keep the flame burning.</p>

<p>The material has a high LOI which means limiting oxygen index. In other words, if set aflame, this textile needs mass amounts of oxygen to sustain the flame, otherwise, it will snuff the flame out naturally. So while the textile is flammable, it is one of the safest natural fabrics regarding fire safety practices. If you go camping, a wool sweater is a great choice of apparel around the campfire.</p>

What Is Slub Knit Fabric?,"
<p>Natural fibers, like cotton or wool, tend to spin unevenly. When spinners got lumps of thicker fiber along the thread they were spinning; the lumps were called slub. The slubs aren’t as tightly twisted as the rest of the thread, making them thicker and softer than the surrounding thread.</p>

<p>Making fabric with slubs in it leads to an uneven texture, with ripples and bumps on the surface. This was a defect, so most spinners picked out the slubs or threw the yarn out.</p>

<p>Machine-spinning helped reduce slub, even in natural fibers. This created the more consistent, uniform fabrics we’re familiar with today. However, this technology also made it possible for manufacturers to create more evenly spaced, intentional slubs.</p>

<p>These intentional slubs create a beautiful visual effect in the final fabric. Slub often takes color differently than the rest of the yarn. Knitting slub into fabric makes a heathered look and texture. You can also use slub for woven fabrics with similar results.</p>
"
What Color is Velvet?,"
<p>I’ve already mentioned that red is the traditional and most popular color for velvet, but blue was also used and other jewel-toned colors such as green. The reason that red and blue are popular for velvet is that they are associated with royalty.</p>

<p>Remember that velvet was originally made from silk, and even during the Middle Ages, silk was a rare and expensive fabric. Velvet fabric was also complex to make without the equipment that we have today.</p>

<p>Considering all of these factors, velvet fabric was expensive. Only the wealthy could afford it, which is why royalty and nobility were the primary wearers of velvet fabric. The fabric could also be woven into different patterns. The color or pattern on velvet fabric was sometimes used to symbolize a specific family. That’s why some noble families may have preferred to wear blue velvet over red.</p>

<p>Due to advancements in how we can make textiles and dyes in different colors, velvet is available in a lot more colors besides just red and blue. But even today, a lot of the colors used for velvet fabric are jewel tones.</p>

<p>Velvet fabric can come in different shades of red, blue, green, and even yellow and purple. And, due to the texture and sheen of velvet fabric, the color can look different at certain angles as a result of how light is reflected from that particular angle.</p>

What Is Rayon Fabric?,"
<p>Rayon fabric is a semi-synthetic fabric usually made out of the chemically treated wood pulp. It’s synthetic because of the chemical processing even though the raw materials are plant matter, called cellulose.</p>

<p>Many manufacturers use rayon fabrics for inexpensive clothing because it is cheap to produce and shares many of the qualities that natural fibers have. The processing also lets manufacturers manipulate these qualities so that the finished fabric more closely resembles a specific fabric.</p>

<p>For example, the earliest rayon fabric was supposed to mimic silk to help save the floundering silk industry in 1860s France. Diseased silkworms created a shortage, so French scientist Hilaire de Chardonnet set out to find a way to make the fabric another way. His discovery is the first known rayon.</p>

<p>Since then, others have adjusted and improved on Chardonnet’s processes. Now, rayon can imitate the look and feel of cotton and linen, not just silk.</p>
"
Is Rayon Breathable Fabric?,"
<p>There are many factors that can contribute to making rayon breathable fabric. A few of them are as follows:</p>

<h3>The Chemical Composition of Rayon Fiber</h3>

<p>Manufacturers take natural raw materials such as bamboo, wood chips, or wood pulp and process them with various chemicals to derive rayon fiber. The resulting rayon fiber is naturally breathable.</p>

<h3>Intended Use of the Finished Fabric</h3>

<p>At every step in the manufacturing process, the manufacturer makes choices that can either enhance the fiber’s breathability or detract from it. These choices will depend on the intended end use of the finished fabric.</p>

<p>Rayon has many possible industrial applications. Besides apparel fabric, manufacturers use rayon to produce upholstery fabric, tire components, stuffing for furniture, and a broad variety of other products. Breathability isn’t an important consideration in finished rayon that’s destined for use in these other applications.</p>

<p>When you’re at a fabric store evaluating whether or not a particular rayon fabric is breathable enough to wear in the summertime, you’ll want to take that fabric’s original intended purpose into consideration. If a particular fabric you’re considering has a lightweight construction and is on a shelf with other apparel fabrics, it’s a safe assumption that the fabric will be breathable and wearable. If you found a rayon fabric shelved with upholstery fabrics, you’re better off assuming that the fabric might not be as breathable as you’re hoping.</p>
"
Is Rayon Stretchy?,"
<p>That said, rayon material can become stretchy when it contains spandex. Like most knits, knit rayon also has more flexibility and will more easily stretch to fit you.</p>

<p>You should also know that rayon has extreme sensitivity to heat and moisture. Unlike many synthetic fibers, rayon fibers can absorb moisture. This causes them to expand when wet.</p>

<p>This also means that you can easily stretch rayon while it is damp because its fibers will expand in this state.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it also causes rayon to easily shrink when exposed to heat. For this reason, you should never put rayon clothing in the dryer!</p>

What Is Acrylic Fabric?,"
<p>Acrylic fabric is made out of acrylic yarns woven or knitted into thick, warm material. This material provides incredible warmth and insulation, making it a popular choice for sweaters, coat linings, and outdoor athletic apparel. This fabric often serves as a cheaper alternative to wool.</p>

<p>The same company that invented nylon designed acrylic during WWII. At the time, textile research had reached new heights, and people thought that synthetic fabrics might entirely replace natural cloth! Acrylic became quite popular in the 1950s, though its insulating abilities meant it mostly saw use for cold-weather clothing.</p>

<p>Then the increased environmental awareness of the 1970s introduced the public to the potential dangers of plastic-based synthetic fabrics. Polyester, nylon, and acrylic continued to see high use, but production dropped off in the United States.</p>

<p>Today, most acrylic manufacturing takes place in China and other Asian countries. Despite its sometimes contentious status in retail clothing, it remains a popular choice for cold-weather clothing today.</p>

What Is Nylon Fabric?,"
<p>Nylon is a manmade fiber first launched back in the 1930s by a company called DuPont. Described as a material stronger than steel, it created quite a buzz at the New York World Fair in 1939.</p>

<p>Touted as having phenomenal elasticity with superior strength, nylon was seen as the textile of the future. With a low production cost and the feel of silk, it’s easy to see why it took the world by storm.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as stocking and tight wearers around the globe discovered, nylon is anything but run-resistant. You only have to snag it a little, and you have ladders in your pantyhose. After a re-think and a brainstorming session, the letters were changed and the company settled on nylon.</p>

<p>With the onset of World War 2, nylon textiles became synonymous with military use. Most famously, nylon was used for parachutes. After the war, the fabric used in the parachutes became a popular material for refashioning into dresses.</p>

<p>The fabric had its fair share of disadvantages. Early nylon material was uncomfortable to wear. Rather than replacing silk, it didn’t breathe, felt clammy, and was susceptible to damage from too much heat and everyday wear.</p>

<p>Not only that but, it suffered from static electricity and could spark without warning. As a textile, nylon was thought to be unstable. Its popularity waned.</p>

<p>Modern-day nylon textiles have come on a long way since those early days. One of the reasons for a revival in its popularity is down to blending. These days, nylon fibers are mixed with polyester, cotton, and spandex. Creating a fabric with all the benefits of nylon coupled with the stability and reliability of its less volatile cousins.</p>

What Is Compression Fabric?,"
<p>Compression fabric is a tight-fitting but stretchy fabric that is made primarily from knitted nylon and spandex. Nylon improves the functionality of the fabric, while spandex gives it elasticity. Some compression fabrics can be made of up to 25% spandex. That means that they can potentially stretch up to 10% in length and 60% in width.</p>

<p>Together, nylon and spandex fibers help create a fabric that is extremely durable and lightweight while still being affordable. The overall design of clothing made from compression fabric helps to improve muscle function by increasing blood flow back to the heart.</p>

<p>Because of their function, compression fabrics are mainly worn by athletes, those with certain medical conditions where blood circulation is an issue or people who spend a lot of time working on their feet. Although some compression fabrics are designed purely for functional purposes, some are stylish as well.</p>
"
Does Lyocell Shrink When Washed?,"
<p></p>

<p>Even after you follow the proper steps and handle the product with care, lyocell will shrink up to approximately 5% after the first wash. However, the benefit of fabrics like lyocell is that it resists further shrinking if properly handled.</p>

<p>The caring procedure of Lyocell involves washing it at the right water temperature. Let’s see how cold and hot water affects the shrinking capacity of this eco-friendly material.</p>

<h3>In Hot Water</h3>

<p>Washing Lyocell under hot water will make it shrink more than usual. Unless you are intentionally trying to shrink the garment to make it sit nicely on your body, avoid continuously washing it under high-temperature water.</p>

<p>High temperature is not considered friendly for Lyocell products. Even if you hand wash the garments in hot water, their chances of shrinking will increase over time.</p>

<p>Lyocell garments are naturally soft and delicate on the skin. If you wash them excessively in hot water, they will lose these main characteristics that set them apart.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you always stick to the cleaning guidelines mentioned on the product’s label. While it is true that lyocell fabric will shrink from 3% to 5% only for the first few washes and will then become resistant to shrinkage, the fabric may have certain vulnerable areas. These sections of the fabric may shrink even further if exposed to high heat for too long.</p>

<h3>In Cold Water</h3>

<p>Regardless of the water’s temperature used for the first few washes, your lyocell garments will still shrink a minimum of 3%. However, apart from this initial shrinkage, cold water is considered appropriate for washing garments.</p>

<p>Whether you hand-wash your clothes or throw them in the machine at a gentle cycle, always use cold water. Your garments will be less likely to shrink, the colors will remain vibrant and intact, the chances of creasing and wrinkling will reduce, and your electricity cost will also be cut down.</p>

<p>If you tend to wash your lyocell garments regularly because of excessive use, you can safely place your bets on cold water.</p>

<p>However, if you are still unsure about the water temperature in which you should wash your lyocell fabrics, always stick to the instructions given on the garment label.</p>
"
What Is Tricot Fabric?,"
<p>Tricot is the name of a specific warp-based fabric. It comes from the French verb, ‘Tricoter’, which means knitting. Pronounced “tree-coat”, or “tree-co” to be closer to its French origins, this fabric is a unique knit material. The reason it stands out from other knits is that it isn’t knitted in the same way.</p>

<p>This is what gives the material its individual texture and durability. It’s also why a tricot fabric is easier to work with than any other knit. With the stability and firmness of woven fabric and the stretch of a knit, the textile has the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Properties of a tricot textile are determined by the fiber content. Their characteristics can include heat-retention, water-absorption, quick-drying, antibacterial, and form-fitting. Whatever the fiber content, all tricot materials are run-resistant.</p>
"
What Is Muslin Fabric?,"
<p>Muslin is a plain-weave fabric. It has one warp thread woven through a single weft thread at a time. Traditionally, muslin is woven with very fine, thin, handspun yarn. The thinness of the fiber and the single layer of the weave makes it a delicate, lightweight fabric.</p>

<p>Muslin is also a very old style of fabric. It dates back to the 13th century when Marco Polo described it after visiting Mosul, Iraq. The city of Mosul also gives muslin fabric its name. However, most muslin historically came from Bangladesh and India.</p>

<p>For centuries, weavers made muslin by hand from beginning to end. They used cotton plants to make thin yarn, then wove that yarn into cloth. Muslin has a loose weave, so a single layer of muslin fabric is thin, flexible, and airy. The labor involved and the high quality of the resulting fabric made muslin incredibly valuable.</p>

"
Does Benzoyl Peroxide Bleach Clothes?,"
<p>Benzoyl peroxide is a strong chemical compound that is frequently an ingredient in acne medication. It kills the bacteria that cause acne in your skin, but at the same time, it can bleach your hair, skin, or clothing.</p>

<p>The oils in your skin can transfer benzoyl peroxide from the surface of your skin onto your clothing easily. Even a small amount of benzoyl peroxide can have a mild bleaching effect on your clothes.</p>

<p>How much it bleaches your clothes depends on how strong the concentration of benzoyl peroxide is, how long it sits on the fabric, and how delicate the fabric is. The longer it sits, the more it will bleach. It will also have a harsher effect on more delicate fabrics.</p>

<p>Beyond acne medication, one of benzoyl peroxide’s primary uses is as a bleaching agent. If you get it on your clothing, it can and will bleach the fabric. The more contact it has, and the longer it sits on the fabric, the stronger the bleaching effect will be.</p>

What Is the Softest Material For Blankets?,"
<p>There are many different kinds of soft fabric, each with its own pros and cons. Whether you’re making your own blanket or buying one, knowing about each fabric’s properties will help you pick the right blanket for your needs.</p>

<p>Some characteristics that make fabric soft are how dense it is, how long the fibers are, and what the fibers are made out of in the first place. Typically, the longer the fiber and denser the fabric, the softer the blanket will be. Add a soft fiber to the mix, and you have an excellent combination for a soft blanket.</p>

<p>You should also consider where you’ll use the blanket and how laundering the blanket will impact the softness. Items like baby blankets or camping blankets that need frequent washing should be a different material than a blanket that only gets a little use.</p>

<p>These six fabrics are all great choices for soft blankets, each with different strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Faux Fur</h3>

<p>The length of the fur in a faux fur fabric has an impact on the softness. There are low pile to high pile faux furs and some furs with a mix of lengths to look more realistic. The lower piles like faux chinchilla and faux rabbit tend to be softer than longer piles like a faux fox.</p>

<p>The density is also important. The closer the individual hairs are on the fabric base, the softer the overall fabric will feel. So the softest faux furs are the ones with a dense low pile.</p>

<p>The drawback to faux fur as a blanket fabric is that faux fur (like real fur) is only soft on one side. The faux hairs are acrylic or polyester fibers that the manufacturer attaches to a fabric base. The fabric base can be any fiber but is generally polyester. Unless the blanket is double-sided, the wrong side will not be as soft as the right side.</p>

<p>The quality of the synthetic fibers will also have an impact. Low-quality faux fur can have a plastic-y feel that a high-quality faux fur will not have. When you wash low-quality faux furs, the fibers can even melt or start to fray, decreasing the softness. If you’re going with faux fur for your blankets, make sure it is high quality and used in a place where it won’t be prone to spills or dirt that would require frequent washing.</p>

<h3>Fleece</h3>

<p>Polar fleece is a hard-wearing, easy-to-launder fabric. It’s usually made from polyester, though it can be made with recycled PET plastics or other fleece. It comes in various thicknesses; generally, the thicker the fleece, the softer it is.</p>

<p>One of the reasons it is easy to care for is because it doesn’t absorb water well, so it repels stains. This makes polar fleece a great choice for a blanket that will get a lot of use or is at risk for dirt and spills. Camping blankets made of polar fleece can be very soft.</p>

<p>The biggest drawback for polar fleece as a soft blanket fabric is that it can easily collect static electricity. If you’re wearing polyester clothes, wrapping up in a fleece blanket could generate unpleasant static electricity while you’re trying to relax.</p>

<h3>Cashmere</h3>

<p>There are two layers of hair on a cashmere goat, the guard hair and the undercoat. The guard hairs are coarse, but the undercoat is soft and fluffy. Both hairs have commercial uses, but the guard hairs are not soft enough for textiles. They’re used for brushes and tools, whereas the undercoat is used for garments and fabrics.</p>

<p>Cashmere goats naturally shed the undercoat, but farmers can also shear the goats to get it. Both processes are labor-intensive, which makes cashmere an expensive fabric. However, some manufacturers blend it with other fibers when they make the fabric to give it other qualities (like elasticity or durability) and lower the cost.</p>

<p>Like sheep’s wool, cashmere must be hand-washed, not machine washed, so it is not an ideal fabric for blankets that get messy easily, like baby blankets. However, it is incredibly lightweight, so you can get softness and warmth without bulkiness, making it a great choice for a throw blanket.</p>

<h3>Flannel</h3>

<p>The yarns that make up the weave are usually spun loosely so that the fibers are fluffier. This gives the fabric the raised nap texture that is so often associated with softness. Brushed flannels are even softer; they are brushed after weaving to raise the fibers and create a thicker nap.</p>

<p>Because it is woven, flannel is usually soft on both sides, especially if brushed on both sides. Cotton and synthetic flannels are great for people who are allergic to wool but still want the look and feel of wool fabric.</p>

<p>Depending on the fiber, flannel can also be easy to wash and dry. This makes it especially good for blankets that get a lot of use. There is even flannel made specifically for children and infants called baby flannel, which makes good baby blankets.</p>

<h3>Wool</h3>

<p>Wool fabric can be woven or knit, and the size of the yarn or thread used in the fabric can make a difference in how the fabric feels. Additionally, felted wool, which is agitated to make it denser, has a slightly different feel to unfelted wool.</p>

<p>The more a manufacturer processes the wool, and the longer the fibers are when they spin it, the softer the wool will be. Wool is also a fairly dense fabric with a natural fuzzy nap. These both contribute to softness.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the biggest factor determining how soft wool fabric will be is how thin the diameter of each fiber is. This is measured in microns, and the fewer microns per fiber, the softer the wool is. Wool with classifications like “ultra-fine” will be softer and smoother than other wools.</p>

<p>Wool is not machine washable, so it isn’t an easy-care material for blankets. It is naturally antimicrobial, so wool doesn’t need frequent washing as long as you don’t spill on it. It will repel dirt and bacteria that cause unpleasant odors.</p>

<h3>Chenille</h3>

<p>The weaving pattern, sometimes called leno, winds two warp threads around each weft. This makes it fluffy on both sides of the fabric. Throughout history, manufacturers have experimented with various techniques to add fluffiness to their chenille.</p>

<p>Manufacturers can make chenille fabric directly, or they can make chenille yarn and then use the yarn to make items like blankets. Regardless of the method, the resulting fabric is a tufted, fuzzy texture, with a pile similar to an extra-thick pipe cleaner.</p>

<p>Chenille comes in a variety of fibers ranging from synthetics to wool, cotton, or silk. Modern chenille fabric usually incorporates some low-melt nylon into the weave. Then, the manufacturer can steam the yarn or fabric, which melts the nylon enough to bind all the fibers together.</p>

<p>This technique means that while chenille fabrics can differ in their overall softness, all chenilles will be a long-lasting soft fabric. Chenille rose to popularity when it was primarily used for bedspreads and carpets, and it is still a very popular option for blankets and throws.</p>

<p>Most chenilles should not go in the dryer due to the low-melt nylon, but otherwise, chenille is an easy-care fabric.</p>

What Is Taffeta Fabric?,"
<p>Taffeta fabric is a luxury fabric known for its stiffness, shininess, and rustling noise it makes. There are multiple types of taffeta, but they share these characteristics and a particular weaving technique.</p>

<p>It’s a plain-woven fabric made with twisted yarns to give it the stiff, crisp texture it’s known for. The fabric holds its shape well despite being lightweight. It’s also often shiny, which makes it a popular choice for formal wear, especially dresses.</p>

<p>The sound taffeta makes is one of its most noticeable characteristics. Because the fabric is so crisp and stiff, it rustles as you move when you wear it. Some fabric experts refer to the sound as “scroop”—a blend of two other sounds, “scrape” and “woop.”</p>

<p>The word taffeta comes from an old Persian word, “taftah.” Its meanings include “woven,” “crisp,” and “twisted.” The fabric originated in the Middle East around the 12th century, though it isn’t certain how similar that original fabric was to modern taffeta.</p>

What Is the Standard Throw Blanket Size?,"
<p>The standard size for most throw blankets is 50 inches in width by 60 inches in length. However, different makers of throw blankets may have what they consider to be the standard size. This is why many throw blankets can vary from these dimensions, including differences in both the length and width measurements.</p>

<p>But, another reason for differences in the size of throw blankets is to accommodate different sizes of people. For example, taller people may need a longer throw blanket, while shorter people prefer a smaller throw blanket.</p>

<p>There are throw blankets that are smaller in length and width that can accommodate smaller people or accent small chairs or beds. A small throw blanket would have dimensions at or around 36 inches by 50 inches. Just for reference, a blanket this size could easily cover a small child’s entire body.</p>

<p>Medium-sized throw blankets typically have the standard dimensions of 50 inches by 60 inches but can be anywhere from 45 inches by 55 inches to 60 inches by 60 inches. These blankets are usually large enough to cover most people comfortably without being overwhelming. They’re also large enough to drape over the back of a chair or couch.</p>

<p>A large throw blanket is considered to be bigger than the standard size. At a minimum, a large throw blanket would likely have dimensions of 50 inches by 70 inches, but some can be even larger. Large throw blankets are the ideal size for people with long legs and may want a little extra coverage.</p>

What Is Mesh Fabric?,"
<p>Mesh fabric is a generic term for any material with a grid-like structure made up of rows of evenly-spaced holes. The size of the holes can vary from small to large, depending on the purpose of the mesh. You can also find mesh fabric made from a variety of materials, from metal to polyester.</p>

<p>Founded by a British Mill owner called Lewis Haslam, mesh fabric has been used in apparel since the late 19th century. Originally known as Aertex, mesh didn’t become part of popular mainstream fashion until the 1980s. Its eventual rise to fame has been attributed to the stars of MTV and pop videos.</p>

<p>As a ubiquitous material, the mesh can be found in products ranging from tea strainers to string vests. You can also find mesh in screen doors and the flyscreens on your windows. Not only is it versatile and practical, but it can also be used as a fashion statement. Creating structure and interest in any garment from fishnet stockings to mesh pullovers.</p>

What Is Ponte Fabric?,"
<p>Ponte fabric is a stable knit made from a blend of polyester, rayon, and spandex. It originated in Italy back in the late 1960s/early 1970s as a fabric for designer clothing.</p>

<p>The full name of the fabric is Ponte De Roma which is Italian for “Bridge of Rome” or “Roman Bridge”. It’s thought the name refers to the pattern of the fabric’s interlocked yarns. They look like little arches. This is reminiscent of the arches found in two famous styles of Roman bridges, the aqueduct and the viaduct.</p>

<p>These days you’ll find the fabric has a few different terms. From Ponte Roma, Ponte di Roma, Ponteroma or the more common, Ponte. In all cases, it is pronounced as Pontee.</p>

<p>Unlike some knit fabrics, Ponte doesn’t unravel or run. It’s a thick fabric compared to other knits because it is a double-layered material. Otherwise known as a stable knit, Ponte has structure, excellent drape, and a comfortable stretch.</p>

<p>The fabric is available in lightweight, mediumweight, and heavyweight options, making it an ideal textile for various projects. You can make form-fitted dresses, comfy pants, and structured pencil skirts from this versatile material.</p>

What Are Chino Pants?,"
<p></p>

<p>Chino pants are a lightweight and comfortable alternative to jeans and formal suit trousers. Made from a cotton twill fabric, they are semi-fitted, making them ideal for casual and formal occasions. Hugging the hips and thighs, they have a gentle taper through the leg, which ends in a close-fitting ankle.</p>

<p>Incredibly flattering for any body shape, chino pants have been part of men’s fashion since the end of the 19th Century. Over time they have become a popular wardrobe stable affectionately known as chinos.</p>

<p>Originally, they were introduced as military apparel worn by Americans fighting in the Spanish-American war of the late 1800s. The war took place in the hot climatic conditions of the South Pacific. Because of this, military uniforms needed to adapt to the warmer temperatures experienced in the region.</p>

<p>The army needed to re-think their uniform strategy. They were looking for a long-lasting, durable fabric that wouldn’t be too hot to wear in the tropics. The answer was a cotton twill weave.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that cotton is one of the best materials you can wear in warm weather. This is because of its breathability and cooling properties. Another advantage is It’s an incredibly durable fabric.</p>

<p>When woven into a twill weave, cotton is one of the strongest fabrics you can get. So much so, people have been working in cotton twill fabrics for generations. When you think of manual labor, what’s the first fabric that springs to mind? Chances are you thought denim, the most famous twill weave fabric on the planet.</p>

<p>Denim is a bit too heavy for the tropics, so a lightweight twill weave fabric was imported from China and turned into a lighter, slimline version of denim pants. These days we would probably have called it denim-lite, but back then, soldiers came up with something a little closer to the situation they found themselves in.</p>

<p>They were fighting the Spanish, wearing pants made from Chinese fabric. What better name could they come up with, other than chinos? In Spanish, Chinos translates as Chinese men. Now, it isn’t known for certain that is the reason behind the name, but it sounds plausible and makes sense.</p>

<p>Modern-day chinos can be worn anywhere. Team them with a baggy t-shirt, and you have a casual look for a walk in the park. Wear them with a dress shirt and smart pair of shoes, and you’re all set for the office. This versatility makes chinos ideal for any eventuality and makes them a perfect fit for a capsule wardrobe.</p>

What Is Chenille Fabric?,"
<p>Chenille is a soft fuzzy fabric with a tufted pile. The surface of the material has both thick and thin sections that create a ridged effect. It can be made from silk, wool, rayon, cotton, and synthetic blends. Considered an elegant fabric, chenille is popular for blankets and upholstery, but it can also be made into clothing.</p>

<p>As far as textiles are concerned, chenille is relatively new in the world of fabric. Although the yarns used to make the fabric can be traced back to 18th Century France, they didn’t appear in garments until the 1830s.</p>

<p>A Scotsman and mill owner called Andrew Buchanan is credited with being the first person to use chenille fabric for clothing. He used chenille yarns to create a textile suitable for use in shawls. These became a popular garment to protect against the variable weather conditions found in Scotland.</p>

<p>Originally, yarns used for the material were created by encasing one weft thread inside two warp threads. The warp threads were twisted together and the weft thread would have been threaded through them. This was known as the leno method. It was labor-intensive and slow-going to make the yarns in that way.</p>

<p>Some enterprising individuals decided to speed things up a bit. There are three names synonymous with furthering the popularity of chenille. First to upgrade the production process was a duo called James Templeton and his partner William Quiglay. They used their patented technique to make rugs.</p>

<p>The most famous name of all came later in the 1890s. A lady called Catherine Evans further enhanced the process of making chenille fabric. She had fallen in love with a super soft quilt she had seen when she was 12. By the age of 15, she’d done it! She’d not only recreated the quilting technique, but she’d also managed to revolutionize the way chenille was created.</p>

<p>Her efforts led to chenille becoming a popular choice for quilts and bedspreads. Although her original intention was to revive a quilting technique known as candle wicking, she helped put Georgia USA on the map for chenille mats, bathrobes, and carpets.</p>

<p>The textile’s name is a nod to its appearance and French origins. The fabric has a fuzzy surface reminiscent of the furry little caterpillars, it became known as chenille. Chenille is the French word for caterpillar.</p>
"
How Much Do Jeans Weigh?,"
<p>The weight of any piece of clothing, including jeans, depends on several things. Fabric choice is one of the main contributing factors. Authentic denim made from 100% cotton will weigh more than a synthetic alternative.</p>

<p>Next, the style of the jeans will make a difference. Due to the fiber content, baggy or regular fit jeans will weigh heavier than skinny jeans. Tight-fitting jeans use stretch denim which contains elastane. The ability to stretch allows the jeans to be cut smaller and use less denim.</p>

<p>Another factor is the size of the item. Adult clothing, especially if it’s made from a heavy fabric like denim, will weigh more than a pair of jeans for a toddler. Simply because adult garments are bigger and contain more material.</p>

<p>Thread count or the thickness of the material used to make the jeans will alter the weight of the denim. A heavier weave will result in heavier jeans.</p>

<p>You’ll also find the number of pockets will make a difference as the more you have, the more material will be in the jeans. Rivets, zippers, and even the number of seams will also affect the overall weight.</p>

<p>Having said all that, jeans are a bit of an anomaly. The weight of 12.5 ounces listed on the price tag of those new Wranglers you bought isn’t referring to the weight of the jeans. Manufacturers don’t tend to weigh the finished garment. They weigh the denim. Or rather the amount of denim per square yard of fabric used to make the jeans.</p>

What Is Batting Fabric?,"
<p>Batting fabric is the fluffy filling layer that forms the inner part of a quilt sandwich. It can be made from many fibers, including cotton, wool, and polyester. Whatever it’s made from, it performs the same role. Adding warmth and comfort to quilts and insulation properties to things like potholders and placemats.</p>

<p>These days you can buy batting in pre-cut sizes wrapped neatly in cellophane bags. There’s a size available to suit most quilts. You can even buy batting off the bolt or roll. In this case, it would be sold by the yard and ideal for custom-sized quilts. But it hasn’t always been that way. You see, ready-made batting is a relatively new invention.</p>

<p>Quilts, on the other hand, have been around since at least the 12th Century, maybe even earlier. Originally, they would have been stuffed with whatever the maker had to hand, from animal hair, human hair, feathers, clothing scraps, old blankets, and even straw.</p>

<p>All of these items had one thing in common. Because they were all individual pieces rather than one large flat piece of fabric, they tended to move. Bits would clump together to create little heaps of stuffing known as wads.</p>

<p>This irritating drawback to the quilts of yesteryear gave quilt stuffing its original name. Traditionally it was called “wadding”. Some parts of the world, such as the UK and Australia, still use the term wadding when referring to quilt stuffing.</p>

<p>If we jump forward to the United States in the 1800s, there’s a change to the fiber content of quilts. You start to see wool and cotton becoming the go-to choice for stuffing. These fibers would be carded into small lumps called batts.</p>

<p>In a similar way to wadding, the process of making the little batts became known as batting. This probably explains why wadding is called batting in the USA.</p>

<p>Regardless of the terminology, both wadding and batting needed to be kept stationary inside the quilt. No one likes a lumpy bedspread, not even back in the 1800s!</p>

<p>The quilt would have been heavily stitched by hand to stop the filling from bunching up. As time went on, this stitching became more and more decorative. Not only did it keep the wadding or batting in check, but it was also a showcase for fine needlework.</p>

<p>These days, modern batting is a single sheet of fibers woven into a fabric. This means there is less need for as much stitching to keep the fabric in check. Quilters still take the time to stitch decorative designs either by hand or machine.</p>

<p>Not only does it allow for two sheets of batting to be stitched together to use up scraps, but it also adds a personal touch to the quilt. In so doing, it keeps old quilting traditions alive.</p>
"
What To Do With Old Sewing Machine?,
What Size Sewing Machine Needle Should I Use?,"
<p></p>

<p>Once you select the right style of needle for your project, you will need to choose a needle size based on the weight of your fabric. Most of the time lighter material works best with a thinner needle, and heavier material does best with a thicker needler.</p>

<p>But how do you pick a thick or thin sewing machine needle? You can easily learn the numbering systems used to explain needle thickness.</p>

<h3>Sewing Machine Needle Sizes</h3>

<p>Sewing machine needle sizes are usually represented as two numbers representing the thickness of the needle’s shaft. How do you know what this measurement means? Let’s get down to the numbers!</p>

<p>Why do needle sizes use two numbers? Well, one number indicates the European method of sizing. The other number uses the American sizing system.</p>

<p>You will see measurements listed both with the European number first and the American second and with the American first and the European second! Yes, this is a bit confusing, but don’t panic! Both measurement systems follow the simple rule that bigger numbers mean a thicker needle.</p>

<p>The European numbers use the metric system, based on hundredths of a millimeter. For example, a needle measurement of 100 means that the diameter of the needle’s shaft is 100 mm thick. This numbering system ranges from 60 to 120, and smaller measurements indicate a thinner needler.</p>

<p>The American system exists because Singer made it popular long ago. It ranges from 8 to 19. Smaller numbers mean a thinner needle in this system as well.</p>

<p>So, if you see a measurement of 12/80, the 12 indicates the American measurement and the 80 indicates the European measurement. A 12/80 ballpoint needle works great with knit materials!</p>

<p>Remember, though, that you might also see this needle size expressed as 80/12.</p>

<p>A thin needle with a measurement like 10/70 (or 70/10) works with fine materials such as silk and organza. You will also need to find a lightweight thread to fit through the small eye.</p>

<p>Thicker needles with high measurements work best with heavyweight fabrics.</p>

<h3>Cotton</h3>

<p>Universal needles in an average size of 12/80 or 14/90 work well with cotton. The eye in this size of the needle will easily allow an everyday polyester thread to fit through.</p>

<p>If you’re topstitching or quilting with cotton material, you may want to use a sharp needle in a 12/80 or 14/90 size instead. You see experts recommend using a sharp with cotton all the time because their tapered points slide through lightweight wovens so easily.</p>

<h3>Knits</h3>

<p>As you already know, ballpoints are the way to go with knit fabrics! Ballpoint needles come in a wide range of sizes, so you should select the size based on the weight of your material.</p>

<p>If you’re working with a heavy knit, you might want a 16/100 ballpoint. If you’re working with a knit so thin and light you can almost see through it, you might want a 10/70 ballpoint.</p>

<p>Of course, if you plan to use a stretchy knit, you may want to consider using a stretch needle instead. This will help you avoid skipped stitches while sewing on challenging material.</p>

<h3>Satin</h3>

<p>For a fine, sleek fabric like satin you typically want a slender universal needle that has a not-too-sharp point with a size of around 8/60 or 10/70.</p>

<p>Satin shows needle marks badly, so make sure you start your project with a fresh needle! If you start to see any runs, puckers, or obvious needle holes as you sew, you may need to replace your needle in the middle of the project as well.</p>

<h3>Sheers</h3>

<p>You need a fine, skinny needle when you work with sheers. Look for the smallest possible measurements of 8/60 or 10/70. You will also need a lightweight thread to blend with your sheer fabric and fit through the small eye.</p>

<p>You will also want to stay stitch whenever possible to keep this type of material from fraying while you sew.</p>

<h3>Denim</h3>

<p>Denim, otherwise known as jean fabric, gets its own special kind of needle! These typically come in higher thickness like 18/110. They have strong shafts and cutting points to sew through heavy or tightly woven material.</p>

<p>You can use this needle for tightly-woven material like canvas, for sewing any kind of jean fabric, and for sewing through multiple layers of fabric.</p>

<p>As a word of warning, not every domestic sewing machine can handle heavyweight fabric. You can buy specialty machines just for working with denim these days!</p>

<h3>Leather</h3>

<p>Cutting point or leather needles work best for leather because they drive a hole through the thick material, just like an awl does when you work with leather by hand. You can buy these in varying sizes based on the thickness of the leather.</p>

<p>Once again, make sure your sewing machine can handle leather before embarking on a project. If you do plan to sew a leather project, buy several replacement leather needles in case they break while you work.</p>

<h3>Quilting</h3>

<p>Quilting needles have a short blade and fine, round eyes. The shortness of the needle allows extra room for you to insert the thickness of your quilt!</p>

<p>You can purchase a number of different needle sizes depending on the type of fabric you use.</p>

<p>Quilting machines and domestic sewing machines may not always accept the same types of quilting needles, so make sure you read the product description before purchasing.</p>

<h3>Embroidery Machine</h3>

<p>Embroidery machines follow all the same rules as domestic machines for needle selection. For example, you will want a ballpoint needle if you plan to embroider on knit material. You will also want to choose a needle size based on the thickness of the fabric.</p>

<p>Machine embroidery may require specialty threads, though. For this reason, read the user’s manual and make sure you select a needle that can accommodate this type of thread.</p>
"
What Is GSM of Fabric?,
What Is Jacquard Fabric?,"
<p>Jacquard fabric is a type of woven or knit material with an all-over pattern. The pattern is made up of different colored yarns or by varying the stitch type. It’s actually woven into the material and becomes part of the fabric surface.</p>

<p>To be classed as a Jacquard fabric, the material has to be woven on a Jacquard loom. The raised sections are formed when the computer-controlled loom selects a pattern of stitches which are then woven into the fabric. Any fabric with a printed or stamped design or pattern is not a Jacquard.</p>

<p>Patterns on Jacquard fabrics are slightly raised. They stand proud against the rest of the fabric and are known as embossed designs. If you run your fingers across the surface of the textile, you’ll feel the raised elements as you work your way across the fabric. These raised portions are a key identifier for Jacquard fabrics.</p>

<p>Many Jacquard materials have long strands of yarn, called floats, on the back. In a similar way to knitting, these are created as the pattern changes to a different color and then picks up the original color later in the design.</p>

<p>You can also get some Jacquard fabrics with a reversed version of the pattern on the rear of the fabric. This shows a negative image. Rather than being raised, the design shows in dips along the back of the material.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of the weave, some Jacquard fabrics can be reversible. With the design visible on both sides of the fabric, it doesn’t matter which side you use. Knit versions of Jacquard are often identical on both the right and wrong sides, making the choice entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Over time Jacquard has become the go-to generic term for any embossed fabric, whether made from cotton, silk, or polyester. Coming under the Jacquard umbrella are fabrics like matelassé, brocade, and damask.</p>
"
What Are Raglan Sleeves?,"
<p></p>

<p>Raglan sleeves attach to a garment in a diagonal line from the armpit seam to the collar and do not have a seam at the shoulder. The two main styles of sleeve attachment used in shirts and other garments are raglan and set-in sleeves. Traditional set-ins use a seam from the armpit to the shoulder to attach a sleeve to a shirt.</p>

<p>The raglan sleeve style is used a lot in t-shirts, long-sleeved tees, henleys, and sweatshirts, though it can have other uses. You see this kind of sleeve a lot in a three-quarter length sleeve and short sleeves for tees and full-length for sweatshirts and cardigans.</p>

<p>For informal tees, raglan sleeves often come in a contrasting color to the body of the shirt. This technique is called color blocking. For instance, you might have a white shirt with red raglan sleeves to show off the unique shape of the sleeve.</p>

<p>But this contrasting color does not actually define a raglan sleeve. The shape of the sleeve defines whether or not a sleeve is a raglan sleeve or a set-in sleeve!</p>

<p>Another common misconception is that raglan shirts are made of “raglan” fabric. There is no “raglan fabric,” though many shirts featuring raglan sleeves use a certain kind of cotton jersey knit. Instead, raglan shirts always contain that special kind of sleeve with a diagonal seam.</p>

<p>Raglan sleeves originated in the 1800s when a famous British general named Lord Raglan lost his arm to a war wound. He wanted a uniform that fit him better following the amputation. To achieve this, he designed the more flexible shape of the raglan sleeve to allow more mobility for sword fighting.</p>

<p>The style gained popularity when baseball teams began to use it in uniform design. Because of this, you sometimes also see shirts with raglan sleeves called “baseball tees.”</p>
"
How Long to Let Tie Dye Sit Before Washing?,"
<p></p>

<p>The basic rule of thumb is to let a tie-dyed item sit for at least 8 and no more than 24 hours before rinsing it and then washing it. Eight to twenty-four hours is a pretty wide range, though, so these next sections can help you narrow down the time window depending on what kind of dye, fabric, and fixative you used.</p>

<h3>Type of Dye</h3>

<p>One of the biggest factors determining how long you need to allow a newly dyed item to rest is what kind of dye you used. The good news here is that whatever kind of dye you bought, you will find directions for resting and washing on the package! Tie-dye kits should also come with clear directions about how long to rest a freshly dyed item.</p>

<p>You can find general guidelines for resting periods based on the type of dye here, but keep in mind that you should always follow the specific instructions on your packaging for the best results.</p>

<p>Typically, you will use either fiber reactive, all-purpose, or disperse dyes for a tie-dye project.</p>

<p>These days, most tie-dye kits contain fiber-reactive dyes such as the Tulip brand, Dharma, and Jacquard brand.</p>

<p>Fiber reactive dyes bond with cellulose molecules inside certain types of fabric, using a strong covalent bond between the color particles and the fabric fibers. This creates a permanent, colorfast, vibrant fabric.</p>

<p>This type of dye works best on fabric that contains cellulose, meaning plant-based materials like cotton and linen. Many artists also use it on silk by adding a few additional steps to the process.</p>

<p>The key thing to know about fiber reactive dye resting periods is that they need to rest for four hours. After this, the color will grow brighter with time. You can allow an item to rest for up to 24 hours for the maximum color saturation or stop closer to the four-hour mark if you want a pale, more pastel shade.</p>

<p>Before the recent development of fiber reactive dyes, most home dyeing projects used all-purpose dyes that easily dissolve into a water bath. Brands like RIT continue to sell quite popular all-purpose dyes often used for tie-dye projects.</p>

<p>This type of dye generally contains a blend of various other types of dyes, like direct and acid dyes. As the name suggests, all-purpose dyes can work on almost all types of fabrics. The only exception is synthetics–any material containing more than 40% of a synthetic fabric like polyester will not hold all-purpose dye.</p>

<p>All-purpose dye has a generic appeal because of this and also offers easy application. But it does not provide the level of colorfastness and color saturation that many other coloring agents can offer.</p>

<p>When dyeing an item using all-purpose dye, you need to let it sit in the dyebath for ten to thirty minutes. However, after that, you do not let the item rest at all! You either rinse it in a color fixative solution or simply wash it in your kitchen sink right away after the dyeing finishes.</p>

<p>Many brands sell accessible at-home disperse dyes. RIT has a line of disperse dyes called RIT DyeMore, for example. Make sure you read the product description to determine that a dye packet actually contains disperse dyes and says that it will work on polyester.</p>

<p>Disperse dye is the only kind of coloring agent that works well on synthetic materials like polyester. Heat and chemical reactions allow the tiny color particles to bond with the plastic fibers inside polyester during the dyeing process.</p>

<p>Because you have to use a boiling water bath to activate this process, you can only create one-color tie-dye using this method (or at least, you can only apply one color at a time!). This makes tie-dyeing polyester quite difficult, but you can do it if you master the intricacies of disperse dyes.</p>

<p>Some brands of disperse dye recommend using a resting period for the damp, freshly dyed item. Others like RIT DyeMore skip this step and inside, take the item right out of the boiling dye bath and put it into a boiling rinse and wash process immediately after finishing the dyeing.</p>

<p>The most important element for fixing the color when using disperse tie-dye is the temperature. You need a building dye bath that simmers for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Acid dyes are not the best choice for tie-dyeing because they require a hot dye bath, just like disperse dyes. Despite that, this is the best kind of dye to use on fabric made out of protein fibers such as wool and silk. Acid dyes do not contain any type of acid, but you add vinegar to the hot dye bath, which activates the color particles and causes them to bind to the proteins.</p>

<p>Jacquard and Dharma both sell acid dyes for at-home use. These will come with instructions indicating how much vinegar to add during the boiling dye bath.</p>

<p>In most cases, you will not let an item sit after this at all. Instead, you will immediately put it into a hot water and soap wash.</p>

<h3>Type of Fixative</h3>

<p>Another factor that can impact the resting period for your tie-dye is whether or not you use a dye fixative.</p>

<p>What is a dye fixative? Most commercial fixatives work on direct, all-purpose, and acid dyes by creating a positive charge that causes the dye particles to swell up inside the fabric. This kind of fixative is called “cationic” because of its positive charge.</p>

<p>Popular brands of fixatives for at-home use include RIT ColorStay, Retayne, and Dharma Dye Fixative. Each product should come with directions telling you how to apply it and how long to let a dyed item rest after using the fixative.</p>

<p>You do not need to use a color fixative on fiber-reactive or disperse dye projects. This product works well on all-purpose dyes and does slow down the inevitable washout of color when you use a product like an all-purpose RIT dye.</p>

<p>You may find that using a dye fixative bath, as RIT recommends, will cause your tie-dye colors to bleed together. So you kind of run into a Catch-22 there–either let the colors fade or let them bleed together as you fix them in place! One way around this is to find a color fixative that comes in spray form.</p>

<p>Either way, using a dye fixative does cut down on the time you need to let the dye rest. For most products, you may only need to let the freshly dyed item sit for 20 minutes after soaking in or spraying on a fixative! Of course, you should always go by the recommended resting period on dye-fixative packaging.</p>

<h3>Type of Fabric</h3>

<p>The type of fabric you use impacts the dye resting period because it determines what kind of dyes you can use.</p>

<h3>Temperature</h3>

<p>Temperature plays a crucial role in determining how long you need to let tie-dye sit before washing.</p>

<p>First, some kinds of dye require high temperatures to bond the color to the fabric. Disperse and acid dyes, for example, both need simmering dye baths.</p>

<p>Second, heat can often speed up the resting period for all-purpose or fiber-reactive dyes. A lack of heat can also make this process take longer. If you wrap up your tie-dyed item and leave it outdoors overnight, the nighttime temperatures could chill the fabric and slow down the setting process.</p>

<p>The good news is that dye kits or individual dye packets will always tell you the ideal temperature for the dye bath and the dye setting period if one is required! A general rule of thumb to remember is that most dyes will set best at temperatures of 70℉ or above.</p>

Is Canvas Waterproof?,
What is A Serger Sewing Machine?,
Does Borax Bleach Clothes?,"
<p>Borax is a naturally occurring salt that releases a small amount of hydrogen peroxide as it dissolves which will boosts your laundry detergent’ cleaning ability. When too much of it is present, hydrogen peroxide can lighten clothes. However, when used correctly Borax won’t cause any harm.</p>

<p>Borax is safe to use on colored fabrics and doesn’t cause bleaching, bleeding, or other damage. It may even be a safer way of removing stains than traditional color-safe bleaches. Borax does not need any added chemical lighteners to reduce staining.</p>

<p>Borax is also safe to use on black clothes, and can even help to keep your colors bolder for longer. In particular, it helps to remove soap residue and soften hard water that can lead to clothes looking faded or dingy.</p>

<h3>Things That Can Affect Color Fastness</h3>

<p>Clothes do fade, and it may not be due to the use of Borax, the color fastness of your clothes can depend on a wide variety of factors. The types of fibers and dyes used in the creation of the clothes, how the fibers or fabric were dyed, as well as the heat of the water used to wash them are just a few of the factors that affect color fasness in clothes.</p>

<p>When it comes to fibers, each type has its own unique properties. Some fabrics, such as polyester, are known for holding colors well. Others, like linen or silk, tend to fade easily. Check the tags to see what fibers make up your clothes to determine how best to wash them to prevent fading.</p>

<p>Darker dyes tend to fade easier than lighter tones, as do many natural dyes versus synthetic ones. Additionally, many synthetic fibers have the dye mixed in as part of their fabrication, while most natural fibers have the dye added sometime later. So, regardless of what type of fabric the clothes are made of, your dark colored clothes may fade simply because of the dyes or the dying processes that were used in their creation.</p>

<p>Water temperature can also be the culprit. Over time, hot water can cause fabrics to lose their colors or to fade. Colder water temperatures are often the best way to help preserve color fastness in your clothing.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about laundry products and your colored clothes, you can always do a test spot. Mix up a small amount of the product using the directions on its container. Then, apply it to an inconspicuous location on the garment and let sit for 30 minutes before rinsing. If the test spot is difficult to discern once it dries, then the laundry product is safe for the garment.</p>
"
What Is Viscose Fabric?,"
<p>Viscose is a lightweight fabric with the look and feel of silk. Introduced back in the 1880s, viscose was hailed as a cheap alternative to silk, making luxurious clothing affordable to the masses. Up until that point, the decadence of silk was reserved for the rich and royalty.</p>

<p>Its popularity was initially short-lived, however. Early viscose fabrics were highly flammable and removed from the market until improvements were made. It wasn’t until the turn of the 20th century that viscose came back. It was this comeback that saw the material get a name change.</p>

<p>Viscose wasn’t seen to be a particularly attractive name. So a new name was introduced. Today viscose is also known as rayon or rayon viscose.</p>

<p>The fabric is derived from plant matter. Unlike cotton or linen, it doesn’t come from the seeds of plants but rather the cellulose found within the plant stems or stalks. Or in the case of viscose, the woody parts of trees and bamboo.</p>

<p>Although it comes from plants, viscose isn’t considered a natural product. To make the wood pulp soft enough to use as a fabric, it is treated with chemicals. This fact prohibits viscose from being classed as a natural fiber. Instead, adding chemicals puts viscose, or rayon, in a hybrid class of its own.</p>

<p>All viscose and rayon fabrics are known as semi-synthetics. Not totally man-made but not completely natural, these materials have the qualities and some of the disadvantages of both natural and synthetic materials.</p>

<p>There are three types of rayon. The best-known version is rayon viscose or viscose. Other members of the rayon family include Lyocell and Modal. While they are all derived from wood pulp, they have different production processes, giving the different variations slightly different properties, making them suitable for different uses.</p>

<p>Model fibers are lighter and tend to be used in outerwear and home décor. Lyocell is treated with an organic substance rather than chemicals, giving it a more ecological footprint. Viscose, however, looks like silk but has the feel of cotton.</p>

<p>It’s not easy to tell the three types apart. You’ll have to refer to your care label to find out which one you are dealing with. However, you may find your fabric is identified by the more generic heading of rayon.</p>

Is Chiffon Stretchy Fabric?,
Does Satin Shrink?,"
<p>Satin is an ever-fashionable and distinguished fabric. For you to maintain its elegance, you must take care of it. Improper washing conditions are one of the areas where people go wrong when handling this material. Satin can shrink between 10% and 20% when exposed to hot water or to hot air in a dryer. Special care, in this case, doesn’t mean following some complex formula but simply adhering to fabric instructions when doing the laundry.</p>

<p>Satin is a very delicate fabric made of natural, synthetic, or blends of fibers.  During manufacturing, the material runs through hot cylinders, a process responsible for its shimmering look. Most people get confused when one type of satin gets distorted after washing or drying while another seems unaffected. Remember when we mentioned that satin is made from different fibers? Polyester satin, for instance, can survive temperatures that silk satin cannot.</p>

<p>Unlike other fabrics, when the care label in satin indicates that you only dry clean it, you must do exactly that or handwash it. Dry cleaning uses a special chemical solvent in place of water. If a cloth is labeled “dry clean only,” it should already tell you that you’re dealing with a very delicate material.  </p>

What Is Acetate Fabric?,"
<p>Acetate fabric is a semi-synthetic fiber. It’s made from the cellulose of wood pulp which has been treated with various acids. These include acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and sulfuric acid.</p>

<p>With a part natural, part synthetic base, acetate fabric has much in common with viscose. Like viscose, acetate is a member of the rayon family, along with modal, lyocell, and cupro.</p>

<p>With a similar luxurious feel to silk, acetate fabric is often used as a cheap alternative. You’ll often find it in bridal wear, prom dresses, and undergarments.</p>

<p>Acetate has been around since the mid-19th century. Although, back then, it wasn’t intended to be used as an apparel fabric. Early examples of acetate were highly flammable and a challenge to work with. So much so that it wasn’t until the early 20th century that an important commercial breakthrough was made.</p>

<p>That breakthrough would be influential in acetate’s success as a fabric, not for clothing but for planes. It was found that exposing early acetate to hydrolysis made it soluble in organic solvents like acetone. The resulting substance was known as cellulose diacetate.</p>

<p>Back in the days of World War 1, plane wings were made of fabric. The newly developed cellulose diacetate was used as a fire-retardant varnish for the wings. Developed by two pioneering Chemists, Henri and Camille Dreyfus, the soluble acetate was in high demand.</p>

<p>However, as the war ended, the need for cellulose diacetate declined. So the brothers, Henri and Camille, changed their focus. Instead of making varnish, they started making diacetate fibers.</p>

<p>In the early 1920s, their company, British Celanese Ltd., began the commercial production of a revolutionary fabric fiber known under the trade name Celanese. Later in that same decade, DuPont introduced a new fabric product to the US, known as acetate fabric.</p>

<p>Further improvements to the initial formulae saw the introduction of triacetate, a fabric that was easier to wash, had better shape retention, and shrink resistance. Depending on where you are, you’ll know triacetate as either Tricel or Arnel.</p>

<p>Acetate is less popular for apparel these days and tends to be used more as a lining fabric. It has been replaced by polyester, which is cheaper and more durable. 100% acetate is particularly delicate and must be either dry cleaned or hand washed, depending on the garment’s care instructions.</p>

<p>To make the fabric more durable, it is more often blended with other fibers. Cotton, silk, wool, and polyester can all be added to acetate to give it extra strength. This also makes the fabric more suitable for busy modern lifestyles. Blended acetate is more of an easy-care material that can be machine washed.</p>

What Colors Go With Purple Clothes?,"
<p></p>

<h3>White</h3>

<p>White is a classic, safe option to pair virtually any color – purple included. It adds a clean and soft finish and will pair well with any shade of purple you wish to match. Wear a purple top with your favorite white skirt or pants, or switch it up and pair a white blouse with purple bottoms.</p>

<p>You’ll want to stick to a pure white color, however. Off-white shades can have yellowish tones, which won’t always work with all shades of purple. If you stray into the off-white range, try to pair it with purple colors with warmer tones – like plum, mauve, or shades with a reddish hue.</p>

<h3>Blue</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Most colors blend well with the primary colors that make them up. In the case of purple, which is made from a combination of blue and red dyes, blue is a natural pairing to make. In particular, the color blue emphasizes the cool tones of purple clothing.</p>

<p>Often the best way to pair blue and purple is to match the shades between the two. You can pair bright purple and bright blue together or a pastel purple and pastel blue. Alternatively, you can mix shades and pair light purple with dark blue or dark purple with light blue colors.</p>

<h3>Beige</h3>

<h3>Red</h3>

<p>Red may not immediately come to mind as a companion to purple clothing, but the pairing can add a bold pop of color to your wardrobe. Red is one of the primary colors that make up purple and it draws out the warm tones contained within any purple clothes you pair it with.</p>

<p>Generally, you’ll want to pair bright red with bright purple clothing for the best match. This is certainly a bold color pairing but is one that has been occasionally embraced by fashionistas worldwide – including the late Princess Diana and Megan, the Duchess of Sussex.</p>

<h3>Gray</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Gray is another popular neutral shade that pairs well with certain purple colors. Gray works especially well with purple clothes that have a gray hue to them, especially lavender tones. You can also pair dark gray clothing with darker purple tones for a moody look.</p>

<p>When choosing gray colors to pair with purple, you’ll want to pay attention to the tone of gray. Gray can appear warm-toned, cool-toned, and have many different undertones in the fabric. You will want to ensure that your purple clothing has the same tones to avoid the gray appearing to be an entirely different shade.</p>

<h3>Yellow</h3>

<h3>Other Purples</h3>

<p>When in doubt, you can always pair your purple clothing with other purples. You can wear the same shade throughout your outfit for a monochromatic look. Alternatively, you can pair your clothing with purples of opposite shades.</p>

<p>Match light purple with dark purple tones to give contrast to your look. Just be sure to stick to similar undertones in the colors you choose. Keep cool-toned purples separate from warm-tone purples since they will look like entirely different colors when placed side-by-side.</p>

How Much Does a Load of Laundry Cost at a Laundromat?,"
<p>The price to do laundry at a laundromat isn’t fixed. It can vary by location – what city you live in and the location of individual laundromats. On average, one can expect to pay between $2 and $4 per load at a laundromat – though that price can fluctuate up or down.</p>

<p>To get an accurate estimate of rates in your area, it would be a good idea to compare a few different laundromats. Keeping in mind that the lowest price isn’t always going to be your best option. You want the place to be sanitary, and you’ll want machines that are kept clean and run smoothly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Besides the actual cost to use the washing machines at a laundromat, there are a couple of other costs you may want to factor in to get an accurate cost overall. Transportation to and from the laundromat should be considered, as well as the need to pay for drying time. Each load of laundry will cost about $5 to wash and dry.</p>

<p>If your household does four loads of laundry per week, this cost comes to $20 per week, approximately $80 per month, or just under $1000 per year – plus a few bucks extra for transportation. Depending on your household size, the number of loads you do per week can vary greatly. This figure should at least give you an idea of the long-term cost of using a laundromat.</p>

<h3>Optimize Visits to the Laundromat</h3>

<p>If doing laundry at the laundromat is your choice, try and optimize your time with each visit. One of the biggest pros of doing laundry at a laundromat is the ability to wash multiple loads at the same time. This cuts down on a lot of time spent waiting – as you do with individual loads at home – so be sure to come with all the items that need cleaning.</p>

<p>Another thing to remember is to bring your own laundry supplies. It may seem like an inconvenience to lug around jugs of laundry detergent. Still, it can save you significantly since purchasing the products that laundromats provide can be exponentially more expensive. You may also want to consider using laundry detergent sheets which are very lightweight and have the added bonus of being waste-free!</p>

<p>If you can, bring work that can be done remotely with you to the laundromat. This way – between switching loads from the washer to the dryer and folding – you can also make progress on other projects that need completing. On the other hand, this could also provide a great time to catch up on some leisure reading. Bringing a book or magazine you’ve wanted to read is also a good choice.</p>

What Color Shirt Goes With Khaki Pants?,"
<p></p>

<p>Khakis are more than just a safe pair of pants to wear to an interview. Like black or grey – they are a valuable and versatile option to keep in your closet. It is widely agreed upon that khakis are neutral in color – though they can also be considered on the warmer side of the spectrum when referring to the color wheel.</p>

<p>Khaki pants can be worn in many different settings and for many different occasions. They can be paired with just about any color, and since they are so neutral themselves, they can handle all sorts of patterns and textures too.</p>

<p>Though a versatile pair of pants – khakis can be casual, dressed up, and business casual – they are not considered formal. While you can wear a pair of khakis to an evening outing in many cases, they should never be worn to formal black tie events. Below are several specific examples of what colors go well with khaki pants.</p>

<h3>Neutrals</h3>

<p>Neutrals complement neutrals! This is true in almost all cases. Black, white, and grey are all wonderful, no-fail choices when looking for a color to match khaki pants. As with many things in fashion, keeping contrast at the forefront is a good idea. If you have a darker shade of khaki pants, pairing them with a crisp white shirt will look sophisticated and clean.</p>

<p>While a lighter shade of khaki will look great with black or dark charcoal grey top. Combining khaki with black or white can also provide a more formal look – and is a great choice for business casual occasions. Whichever shade you choose, pairing neutrals will give you a simple, muted look that is also thoughtful, and classic look.</p>

<h3>Warm Tones</h3>

<p>Warm tones – particularly pinks and reds – make a great mate for khaki pants. Similar to above, it is important to keep contrast in mind when considering the shade of the shirt you want to pair with the pants. A light pastel pink will look great combined with a slightly darker shade of khaki. While a brighter red – or even dark burgundy – would look better against a lighter pair. Keep in mind which season you are dressing for when selecting the hue to be worn.</p>

<h3>Cool Tones</h3>

<p>Blues and greens can be matched well with many things – khaki pants are no exception. These cool tones are a perfect complement to the slightly warmer hue of khakis. There are countless shades of blue and green to choose from, giving you almost unlimited options. Dark jewel tones would pop when paired with a classy pair of light khaki pants.</p>

<p>While pastel blues and greens can give life to a pair of khakis of a darker shade. Don’t forget about purple! Purple can add an element of interest to an outfit by being included. Lavender, violet, or royal purple – virtually any shade would do well with the right pair of khaki pants.</p>

<h3>Patterns</h3>

<p>As an unassuming item of clothing, khaki pants are a great companion for a fun patterned blouse or a bold color block shirt. Many tops that may be too loud otherwise will be perfectly understated when paired with neutral khakis. Sweaters, stripes, and florals can take your khaki ensemble to the next level. While flannel and plaids of many colors – in the right season – provide another classic, more casual combo.</p>

How Long Should Dress Pants Be?,"
<p>How long your dress pants should depend on several different factors. The first thing to consider is what overall style you are going for. Traditional dress pants tend to fall below your ankles, resting on top of your shoes and partially covering your laces.</p>

<p>However, more modern styles of dress pants often fall higher up on your ankle, showing off a small portion of your socks. These pants will be slimmer fitting and a bit more casual. If this is more your style, you want the pants to end right at or slightly above your shoes when you wear them.</p>

<p>You may also want to consider your height and body type in choosing your pant length. If you are slimmer and average in height, the shorter pant length will work well for you. If you are heavier and taller, you’ll want to consider some of the more traditional pant length options.</p>

<p>Even then, the final choice is up to you and your preferences. It is no longer the case that all dress pants need to be tailored to look the same. People all across the world are getting more and more creative with how they wear and style their dress pants.</p>

What Color Shirts Go With Black Pants?,"
<p>In theory – everything goes with black. While this statement may be true, it doesn’t mean that every color that goes with black can be worn every occasion. Black can be the backdrop for another garment to shine, or it can be the focal point itself – it all depends on the style.</p>

<p>The good news is – there are endless options to choose from. The toughest part is choosing which option you want to go with. Below we will go over some specific colors that can create pleasing combinations when paired with black pants. Remember – different shades of different colors can produce different looks, creating even more diversity and the possibility of dressing for even more occasions.</p>

<h3>White</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Black and white is a classic fashion combo. One of the main reasons it works so well is contrast. When you’re aiming to put a cohesive, eye-pleasing look together – contrast is always a good place to start. Having contrasting colors and shades creates pleasing visual stimulation while also adding balance.</p>

<p>Pairing a white shirt with black pants, generally, is going to create a more formal look. This is a great combination for an interview, business casual and most formal occasions, or any time you want to come off as polished and well put together. A very safe choice – you can’t go wrong wearing a white shirt with black pants.</p>

<p>You can dress this combo up or down depending on the specific styles of the shirt and pants and the accessories you choose to wear with the outfit. A white t-shirt will never look as formal as a button-down blouse but will still look thoughtful and clean. A black and white outfit is also a great place to add a fun pop of color or a bright accessory. Depending on the occasion – this may be the perfect opportunity to wear a super colorful pair of shoes – or your favorite bold sweater.</p>

<h3>Grey</h3>

<p>Grey is slightly more subtle than white. Of course, it comes in many shades – but it will provide the same eye-pleasing contrast you should aim for to create a well-balanced outfit. Pairing a grey shirt with a pair of black pants will give you a fashionable monochrome look.</p>

<p>Technically, any shade of grey will work. A darker charcoal grey can blend in with the pants – giving you an overall dark outfit that would be better for winter or fall. Light to a medium shade of grey will provide beautiful contrast for a monochrome outfit that could be worn in any season.</p>

<p>Grey is another color that is easy to dress up or down and pair with other fun colors or patterns. Use the subtlety this combo offers to add a statement piece to your outfit. An otherwise loud pair of shoes or chunky gold jewelry would work seamlessly with this understated combo. Alternatively – add any other color that works well with grey – pink or yellow, for example – to a monochromatic black and grey outfit.</p>

<h3>Blue</h3>

<p>A cool blue shirt would pair nicely with a pair of black pants. Try and choose a shade that gives you some contrast – anything light to medium is a great match for a calming, relaxed look. This doesn’t mean it won’t look professional – just that you’ll be giving off cool and confident vibes. This is also one of the best color combos for colder weather – grounding dark pants with a cool-toned blue top.</p>

<p>With blue being such a versatile color and with so many shades to choose from – the style of the shirt is going to be key for putting the perfect outfit together. A light blue button-up or stylish flowy blouse would be great for the workplace – an approachable, business casual look. A medium blue sweater can easily be dressed up or down when paired with black pants – another great choice for winter months.</p>

<h3>Red</h3>

<p>Red is bold and bright – one of the most eye-catching colors on the spectrum. Black is the perfect counterpart to tone down even the brightest shades. If you want to wear red, it works best paired with something neutral to avoid being over the top. Black can stand up to candy apple red – though it’s best to include a lighter neutral when wearing this combo. Black pants will also work great with a darker red hue. A solid-colored red shirt could be dressy or casual – a pattern that has a red element would work well with black pants too.</p>

<h3>Pink</h3>

<p>Black and any shade of pink were made for each other. The playful, flirty, and sometimes vibrant aesthetic that comes with pink is perfectly balanced when it’s paired with black pants. The combinations are endless, with opportunities to dress for any occasion, from weekday fun to a formal night out. Light shades of pink offer welcome contrast – the style choices for light pink tops are endless – a great shade to wear during spring. Bold, dark pink can create quite a statement – the hue could be similar to black while being bright enough to still provide contrast. This color combo could work well for fun, but daring, winter look.</p>

<h3>Green</h3>

<p>Green in differing shades can be bold or subtle – in either case, a good look with black pants. This cool color can – depending on its vibrancy – be worn in any season. Pale sea green is a perfect color for spring and would give great contrast over black pants. Brighter shades – such as lime or chartreuse – may be more daring but also work with black. Slightly darker shades – like Kelly or emerald – are colorful with still enough contrast and are good greens for summer. The darkest and most muted green tones can work throughout winter and fall – hunter, army and olive green would all fall under this category.</p>

<h3>Yellow</h3>

<p>Cheerful yellow is visually pleasing when paired with rich, dark black. This combination is often found in nature – which is a testament to its aesthetic appearance. A pale yellow top paired with black pants would be the right shade for spring.</p>

<p>Go a bit darker and brighter with a sunflower shade for summer. But coming into fall is where the yellow and black combo shines.</p>

<p>Gold, ochre and mustard tones – the ones that make you feel warm even when the weather is cool – look stunning contrasted with black.</p>

How Much Does It Cost to Tailor Pants?,"
<p></p>

<p>Always remember that the cost to tailor pants will vary based on where you live, who you take the pants to, and how much work is needed. Pants will often need multiple types of alterations to make them fit well. For example, taking the waistband in to be narrower may require you to take in the legs to make them fit along your thighs. This will increase the costs.</p>

<h3>1. Waistband Adjustments</h3>

<p>One of the places that your pants are most likely to fit incorrectly is at your waist. Pants that fit too loosely or too tightly won’t look good and will probably be uncomfortable to wear. Your tailor should be able to make the waistband smaller by up to several inches and may also be able to make it larger if there is extra fabric available.</p>

<p>Adjusting the waistband is fairly simple and won’t break the bank. Most tailors will do this type of alteration for prices ranging from $10 to $25. The less that has to be done, the lower the cost.</p>

<p>If your pants only need to be taken slightly around the waist, you may want to try shrinking them before you pay for alterations. Learning how to shrink clothes safely is fairly easy to do. Always be sure, however, to check the tags on the pants before you apply heat to make sure that it is safe.</p>

<h3>2. Removing Belt Loops</h3>

<p>If you have a pair of pants with belt loops that you don’t use, you can have them removed altogether. The same goes for if you have your waistband made smaller, and some of the loops shift to be too close together. Either way, it’s a fairly simple fix for your tailor to remove these pieces of fabric.</p>

<p>Because this is such a simple fix, the cost is pretty low. You should expect to spend somewhere between $5 to $10 to have belt loops removed from your pants by a professional tailor.</p>

<h3>3. Replacing Buttons</h3>

<p>It’s probably a safe bet to say that everyone has had a button on their clothes catch on something as they go about their daily activities. If the button becomes loose or falls off, a tailor can easily replace it with a new one. The same goes for if you have a button on your pants that you don’t like the look of and would like a different style.</p>

<p>Button replacements are also fairly simple to do and relatively cheap fixes. Many tailors will charge between $5 to $10 for these fixes by themselves, perhaps a bit more if they need to custom order a button for you. For simple buttons, however, some tailors may even throw this repair in for free if you’re paying for a lot of other work to be done to the pants.</p>

<h3>4. Zipper Repairs</h3>

<p>Zipper repairs can sometimes be tricky since the old zipper will typically have to be removed and a new one is sewn into its place. If the new zipper doesn’t lay right, it can ruin the look of the entire front of your pants. Because of this, you only want to take zipper repairs to skilled and trustworthy tailors who can do this repair well.</p>

<p>A new zipper will run you more than some other repairs on this list. You should expect to spend between $10 to $25, with the cost being a bit higher if your tailor needs to custom order a zipper for your pants.</p>

<h3>5. Adjusting the Rise</h3>

<p>The rise of your pants affects how high they sit on your hips or waist when you’re wearing them. A tailor can shorten this rise, helping the pants sit higher up on your body. They may also be able to make this rise longer, but only if there’s extra fabric available. Either way, this change won’t be drastic.</p>

<p>Fixing the rise on your pants is one of the most difficult fixes a tailor could do; many try to avoid it if they can. The added difficulty raises the price a bit, but you could still expect to pay between $20 and $40 for this alteration.</p>

<h3>6. Taking in the Legs</h3>

<p>If your pants are too loose around your thigh, knee, or calf areas, a tailor can take them in to fit a bit slimmer. However, they probably won’t be able to widen this area since most pants will not have extra fabric to work with around these parts. Even then, taking the legs in is a pretty common fix.</p>

<p>Your price tag for this alteration will likely fall between $15 to $25, depending on how much work needs to be done. The price can also vary based on how complicated the pants themselves are, such as whether or not they have a lining or cuffs to contend with at the bottom.</p>

<h3>7. Tapering Leg Openings</h3>

<p>Speaking of the bottom of the pant legs, your tailor can also taper the openings to be smaller. This gives more of a “skinny leg” look to your pants, which many modern styles have adopted. This is also a fix that varies in price based on how complicated the pants are, especially if they have cuffs.</p>

<p>Still, most tailors will charge you between $10 to $25 to taper the leg openings of your pants. This is often required when you take in the legs, so don’t be surprised if your tailor suggests both steps are needed during your alterations.</p>

<h3>8. Hemming Pant Legs</h3>

<p>Finally, your tailor should be able to make your pant legs shorter to better fit your height. Hemming pants is fairly easy to do but can cost a bit more if the pants have cuffs or some other decorative finish to contend with.</p>

<p>Even then, hemming is usually pretty affordable. You’ll probably spend between $10 to $25, depending on how complicated the pants are. If you hem the pants too high, don’t be surprised if you also have to taper the openings to keep them from being too wide as you move higher up the pant leg.</p>
"
What Colors Go With Beige Clothes?,"
<p>Beige is an excellent addition to your wardrobe since it can be paired with any color. However, there are some pairings that just seem to work better than others. We’ve gathered together a list of the best options below.</p>

<h3>Brown</h3>

<p></p>

<p>As we’ve already said, different shades of the same color pair well together in an outfit. Brown just so happens to be a darker beige shade, meaning it will pair well with beige clothes. It’s the same type of pairing you would get, for example, if you paired a light blue shirt with some dark blue jeans.</p>

<p>Consider wearing beige pants with a brown suit jacket or another top. Reversing that, you could also pair brown pants with a cozy beige sweater. Either way, these two colors will complement each other well, no matter what outfit you put together.</p>

<h3>Olive Green</h3>

<p>Beige will pair well with most shades of green; however olive green is probably the best green you could choose. This is because olive green is an earthy, warm color, much like how beige is a warm color. Olive green often has brown undertones, which also pairs well with the lighter browns in beige clothes.</p>

<p>Consider finding a pair of olive green cargo pants to pair with a beige sweater or cardigan. An olive green blazer is also a good option to wear over top of a beige button-up shirt. You could choose from a million different outfits with these two colors.</p>

<h3>Mustard Yellow</h3>

<p>Yellow is sometimes an iffy color when it comes to making beige outfits. However, mustard yellow is almost always a good choice to wear with beige. It’s dark enough to create some contrast and typically has warm brown undertones that pair well with beige.</p>

<p>A pair of bold mustard pants are an excellent option to style with a beige blazer or dressy top. You could also find a long, cozy mustard cardigan to wear with your favorite pair of beige pants. These two colors are great for creating an overall warm and cozy look.</p>

<h3>Coppery Orange</h3>

<p>Since beige, like other shades of brown, is closest to the orange family of colors, most shades of orange will pair well with it. However, copper or rust-toned oranges seem to work best with beige because they are warm and have a lot of brown undertones.</p>

<p>I love pairing an oversized copper-orange sweater with a pair of beige pants for everyday wear. Rusty tones of orange also seem to be a popular option for women’s dress pants and you could make some fun, stylish pairings with those and a beige blouse. These two colors will work together no matter where they appear in your outfit.</p>

<h3>Blush Pink</h3>

<p>Most of the colors we’ve paired with beige so far have been very bold or even bright. Blush pink is often the opposite of that and is typically much softer and paler in color. Nevertheless, blush pink and beige make a great pairing in any wardrobe.</p>

<p>If we think back to the color wheel and where orange is situated, we say it is right next to the red wedge on the wheel. This means that orange and red are colors that will work well together. Since beige is a lighter shade of orange and pink is a lighter shade of red, it makes sense that the two colors will go together well.</p>

<p>Consider layering a blush pink blouse or sweater underneath a beige jacket for a soft, neutral look. Blush pink pants also pair well with a beige sweater. You can pair both of these colors with white for even more of a light and airy look.</p>

<h3>White</h3>

<p></p>

<p>On the topic of white, this color also makes a great pairing with beige clothes. White is the ultimate neutral, going with any color on the color wheel. It’s natural then that white and beige will go together well, creating a light neutral look that’s perfect all year round.</p>

<p>A white button-down shirt and beige dress pants are a classic office look suitable for most workplaces. You can also flip this outfit around and wear a pair of white jeans with a beige sweater and cardigan for a more casual look. There’s no way you can go wrong pairing these two colors together.</p>

<h3>Black</h3>

<p>There is a little debate as to whether or not black is a great pick to go with beige, but we think it is! Indeed, black and brown aren’t usually a good match for one another. But beige is so light that it creates enough contrast with black to make a good overall look.</p>

<p>You will have the most success in pairing black and beige if you choose black clothes that have a bit of a warm undertone to them. This will bring out the warm undertones in the beige. Try to stick to lighter shades of beige and avoid anything that begins to look a bit too brown.</p>

<p>The most classic black and beige outfit you can wear is a black top with beige pants. If you’re looking for a safe option, this is what we recommend.</p>

<h3>Beige-on-Beige</h3>

<p>When it comes to wearing trendy beige clothes, many celebrities have made all-beige looks popular in recent years. This creates a monochromatic, neutral look that has appeared all over fashion magazines and runways, showcasing the latest styles. The trick to pulling off these looks is to keep the clothing simple and to make sure that everything is the same shade and tone of beige.</p>

<p>Consider hunting down a pair of beige track pants to wear with a beige hoodie and sneakers for a casual look. Beige suits have also become a popular menswear item if you’re looking for something appropriate to wear to the office.</p>
